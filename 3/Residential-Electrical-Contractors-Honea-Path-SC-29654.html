<p>House must have GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet. A service panel upgrade to 100 amps costs $850 to $1,600, a 200-amp breaker box replacement costs $1,800 to $2,500, and a 400-amp electrical service upgrade costs $2,000 to $4,000. One of the main factors to consider when deciding between hiring a lighting professional or doing it yourself is the scope of the design. If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>

If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.
