Contact us for help selecting the electric and power solutions you need. Contact our Roanoke electricians at (540) 253-1559 if you need help with outlets, switches, and dimmers in your home.</p>
<p>Do have any problems with your receptacles and switches. Automatic Power on Standby: When utility power fails, it comes as a shock to realize how much we rely on technology and others to provide simple requirements like air conditioning and lighting Now you can always have a reserve power supply that can fill the void left by utility power failure. Side Wired: Hook the wires to the terminals and tighten terminal screws. Here at Advanced Electrical Company, we understand just how important your electrical system is to the overall function, safety, and efficiency of your Birmingham home or business, and the level of trust you are placing in us when you hire us to service it. With that in mind, we make it our mission to make sure you never feel as though that trust has been misplaced.</p>
<p>Most standby generators are big. Electrical panels installed after 2000 are quite safe and reliable. On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present. Some of the new L.E.D. landscaping lights are amazing. Be careful not to overload one surge protector with equipment that uses a lot of energy; divide the load between several surge protectors.</p>
