A generator takes energy from a fuel source and uses the principle of electromagnetic induction that was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 to turn it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>A generator is a back-up electrical system that operates regardless of if you are at home or away. We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office. Besides having a circuit breaker that can handle multiple electronic devices at once without overloading, upgrading your service panel has other advantages, as well. It's easy to improve the energy efficiency of lighting systems by up to 90% when you use lower voltage lighting.</p>
<p>Fuses or circuit breakers of greater amperage will not correct too-small wiring or low-voltage problems, but proper circuit protection will ensure safe use of what you have. So using LEDs to light your landscape can actually help save the planet. This happens when your devices don't have any protection in place against a sudden surge in electricity.
