Whether you work in a busy office or are a stay-at-home parent, there's nothing worse than waiting for hours for an electrical service provider to turn up. When you book electrical contractors through the Handy platform, you can be sure that they'll turn up on time and ready to work.</p>

We offer 24-hour electrical repair services so we're ready when you need us. Problems with your electricity are often urgent and need to be taken care of immediately. The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>
