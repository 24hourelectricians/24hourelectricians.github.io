Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle. Always be sure to hire a professional for wiring and panel upgrades; this type of work requires the skills of a licensed electrician for the optimum safety. Master Electrician License: A journeyman electrician's license is required.</p>

This can prevent data and power loss during the transfer of power to the generator. You must have had a minimum of 8,000 hours of experience.</p>
