<p>When you have a generator installed, it will be able to detect the power outage and will kick into gear to keep the power running. It is very important to purchase the correct transformer for your lighting system. The investigation looked only into the wire connections at the outlets. The wrong type of electrical wiring was used to power the lights.” Rather than the wiring specified by the manufacturer of the LED lights, communications wiring that is used for items including voice, data and audio transfers was employed.</p>

The next day she spent too much time on hold with the customer service numbers for the transformer and the light manufacturer.

A transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold. As the wiring corrodes the flow of electricity is slowly decreased causing lights to burn dimmer. If you want outdoor lighting installed for your residential or commercial property, our team can help.</p>
<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you may want to install or upgrade your outdoor lighting. Again this is just a general rule of thumb for most electrical house wiring. It's easy for the electrical equipment that we see every day to fade into the background, but it's important to always take safety precautions around it.
