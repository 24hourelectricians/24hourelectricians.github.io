Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power. To remove the defective switch, disconnect the two wires from the terminals by loosening the screws in a counter-clockwise direction. Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>
