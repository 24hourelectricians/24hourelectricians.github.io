<p>An electrical and electronic installer is responsible for testing, operating and repair of equipment and tools that make use of electronic technology. This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring.

Pull the plug, not the cord, when disconnecting an electrical device. This flaw can lead to damage to the panel, breakers and home electrical devices, or cause a fire. This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
