<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation.

<p>While courses and paperwork might be all you need to pass exams and certifications, there's just no substitute for experience. Even though it's not an appealing thought for homeowners, rats and mice love to chew on electrical wires, as well. This is to keep your family, especially the children, safe from electric shock. Have a qualified electrician check your wiring on a regular basis to ensure wiring is safe.
