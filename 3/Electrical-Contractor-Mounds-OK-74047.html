The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed.

Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them.
