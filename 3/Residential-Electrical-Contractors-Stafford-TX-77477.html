The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>To qualify, you must have 6 years' experience in a specialty area directed by an authorized master special electrician, or licensed master electrician. Don't worry about having to be there to start and stop your Generac home backup generator.
