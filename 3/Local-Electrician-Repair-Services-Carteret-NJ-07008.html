The transformer or power supply usually has a built-in time clock to allow the system to be turned on” and off” at a preset time. So manufacturers just started to dual rate the THHN wire for both so that they didn't have to run two separate wires every time. Egress lighting typically lasts 10 years , as long as the lights used are LED and not incandescent lamps. To make it a half hot you will have to run new wire from the switch to the outlet.

Lights using low voltage power connections will be relatively smaller as compared to all other types of 120-volt lights including incandescent bulbs.
