In addition, you can get surge protectors specifically designed for phone and cable lines.

Offering good illumination while not overpowering you, low voltage systems are ideal for the twilight hours.</p>
<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
<p>If it is, though, you can make any or all of the outlets half hots. We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless. The result is damaging surges traveling to important electronics elsewhere in the house.</p>
