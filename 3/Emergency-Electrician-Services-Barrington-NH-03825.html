<p>Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is not easy. Many local governments mandate that businesses must hire a licensed electrician when doing any electrical work in commercial buildings, especially those used by the public.

Only applicants who have been approved by the Montana State Electrical Board will be allowed to register for an exam PSI is the exam vendor for the State Electrical Board.

A lightning surge protection device creates a barrier that prevents electricity from spiking suddenly during a storm. In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
