<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Rustburg</h2>
<p>Electrical contracting is a massive industry valued at more than $130 billion annually. My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician.
