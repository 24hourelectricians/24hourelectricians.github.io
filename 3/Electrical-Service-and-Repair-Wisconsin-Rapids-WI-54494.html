Some of the perks of our protection plan are our priority service, annual whole-house safety evaluation, and discounted services. Sometimes these are just pretty things to look at.

<p>Consequently, electricians with less than a year of experience make up just 2 percent of the workforce. Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle.

<h3>How Surge Protectors Work Wisconsin Rapids WI 54494</h3>
<p>So bottom line is to separate the white wires as well. Services include electrical emergency service, lighting installation and repair, and commercial rewiring and wiring and repair services. The electrical panel is the center of your home's electrical system. If the voltage rises above 120 volts, there is a problem, and a surge protector helps to prevent that problem from destroying your computer. The completed projects gallery can be filtered according to the type of service.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems. They can be installed in the ground to uplight statues, fountains, flag poles, trees, or your company logo. As long as you take note which wires go to which terminal and copy this arrangement to the new switch, everything should work correctly. Enhance the nighttime curb appeal of your home—and add a measure of safety and security—with low-voltage landscape lighting.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting looks more appealing when the source is unseen. Lighting the entrances and walkways of your home is not only beautiful, but it also increases your safety and keeps key areas visible when you're outside at night. We also work hard to save you money with our quality installation and repair services. Or, a faulty circuit breaker or an outdated fuse box may need to be replaced. Before purchasing an electric vehicle (EV), consumers should have a licensed, qualified electrician perform an electrical evaluation of their home to determine that their home's electrical system is adequate for EV charging.</p>
<p>Illuminate a pathway with large-scale lanterns, use LED landscape lighting to illuminate trees and bushes, and make use of low voltage landscape lighting to light up an outdoor seating area. Electrical wiring is a job that should be left to professionals. Except for the transformer that is connected to the 120v circuit, all the fixtures run on harmless 12v current. This National Electrical Safety Month (NESM), the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) is increasing public awareness of electrical hazards in both the home and in the workplace with its Be in the Know about the New” NESM consumer awareness campaign and the newly released How Do You Know?” workplace safety awareness program.</p>
<h3>Electrical Installation Services in Wisconsin Rapids WI</h3>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later. The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>
<p>Even when you shut off the main breaker, the lugs still carry live electricity. Electrical panels do more than distribute electrical power to the many different devices thru your home, they protect you against electrical shorts and circuits overloads that can cause a fire.
