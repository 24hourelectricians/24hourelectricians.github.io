If the electrical work passes, the utility company can reconnect the outside power lines. Talk to Weisman Electric Company about a preventative maintenance plan to keep your generator as efficient as possible. There have been many accidents about fire and shocks caused by electricity. Power boards - when these cannot be moved out of a child's reach, they should at least have inbuilt safety switches to prevent electrocution.</p>

<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable. In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, upgrading an electric panel makes financial sense when factoring in issues with homeowners insurance and safety concerns without outdated equipment.
