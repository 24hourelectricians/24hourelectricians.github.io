Repairs could be minor and nominal in cost, such as the cleaning and tightening of connections or the addition of outlets, or more involved running into several thousand dollars, such as the addition of circuits and sub-panels, replacement of degraded wiring, or, particularly with older homes, a heavy-up” — that is, upgrading the electrical service from, for example, 60 amp or 100 amp service to the home to 200 amp service better able to handle today's electric demands.</p>

If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller.
