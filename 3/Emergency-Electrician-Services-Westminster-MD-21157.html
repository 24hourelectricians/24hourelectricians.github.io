<p>A line of switches on the wall can detract from the room's style. Low-voltage landscape lighting for the backyard needs only an outdoor receptacle and a transformer. After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses.

<p>While most installers use the listed SPT-3 cable, there may be circumstances where a different cable would be installed. Rudy and his helper were on time, fixed 4 plumbing issues.
