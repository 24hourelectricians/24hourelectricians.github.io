The National Electric Code (NEC) requires that low voltage power supplies and electrical wiring be Class 2 compliant. For installation, you can use the stakes to simply press the lights into the ground or use the included screws to mouth the light to the wall, depending on your needs. This course is designed to familiarize participants with basic principles associated with the parts and operation of electrical circuits.</p>
<p>If your home still relies on an old-fashioned panel with fuses, which is common in homes built prior to 1960, then you probably want to upgrade to an electrical panel with circuit breakers.
