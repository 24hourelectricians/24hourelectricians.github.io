That in turn depends on the manufacturer of the panel, and the quantity and type of breakers installed. These kinds of electricians may repair motors, transformers, generators, and electronic controllers on machine tools and industrial robots. By building a rapport with an electrician, you can be sure that they will be there to help when you need their services.</p>
