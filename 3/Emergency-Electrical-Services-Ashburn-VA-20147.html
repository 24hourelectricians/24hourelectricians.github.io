Your panel is also known as your fuse box, fuse panel, or circuit breaker panel, and is designed to trip and shut off when too much current flows through one particular circuit. A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch. To start, the wiring from the outlet to the switch does not seem to carry the ground over; I can see it terminated at the end of the sheath right where it comes into the light switch box.</p>
