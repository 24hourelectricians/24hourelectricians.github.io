As you prepare for a career as an electrician, Electrical Wiring I of the electrical wiring series will provide training in the installation of residential electrical circuits. This suspicion could be confirmed with the use of a voltmeter With the circuit energized, after the Start button had been pushed, place the voltmeter probes at positions 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3. A no voltage reading at 1 and 2 with a voltage reading between 1 and 3 and between 2 and 3 would confirm that M2 is open.</p>
<p>A common set-up is for two switches at opposite ends of a room to control one overhead light.
