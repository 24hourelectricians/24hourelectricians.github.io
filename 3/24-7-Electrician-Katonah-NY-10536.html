Additional outlets can be powered from either that or the switch box by using the permanent hot and the neutral from either the switch box or the outlet box.</p>

If the electrical work passes, the utility company can reconnect the outside power lines. Talk to Weisman Electric Company about a preventative maintenance plan to keep your generator as efficient as possible. There have been many accidents about fire and shocks caused by electricity.
