However, if you are looking for the ultimate backup system, then a 48kW generator is capable of producing the power needed to run your home like a blackout never occurred. Remember, the intent is to provide enough light to provide safety, beauty & security.</p>
<p>If one or more of the phases is missing, disconnect the primary voltage source (incoming power disconnect switch) and replace the incoming power fuses or reset the motor-control circuit breaker. That way the second outlet can be switched while leaving the GFI on at all times.

We offer a full range of electrical services to keep your home running in top shape. Houses built or rewired more than 30 years ago may have 60- or 100-amp service (amps are a measure of the quantity of electric power).
