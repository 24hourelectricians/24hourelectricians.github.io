The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed. This can save you money by turning off the pathway lighting or special art enhancing spotlights after certain hours of the night.</p>
<p>A common set-up is for two switches at opposite ends of a room to control one overhead light. White wires are normally used to connect to other white wires or to chrome terminal screws on switches and receptacles.
