<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Madison</h2>
<p>The Residential Electrician C.T.S. Program is designed to prepare students for residential entry-level electrician positions. Electrical work is defined in the Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991 and means work on electrical machines or instruments, on an electrical installation or on electrical appliances or equipment to which electricity is supplied or intended to be supplied, at a nominal pressure exceeding 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct current, whether or not the thing on which the work is being performed is part of, or is connected to or to be connected to, any distribution works or private generating plant and, where work is performed on any appliance, whether or not electricity is supplied or may be supplied thereto through an electric plug socket or socket outlet.</p>
<p>If one or more of the phases is missing, disconnect the primary voltage source (incoming power disconnect switch) and replace the incoming power fuses or reset the motor-control circuit breaker. That way the second outlet can be switched while leaving the GFI on at all times. Our professionals meet warranty stipulations, ensure safe and proper operation, and are always here to provide Emergency Assistance, 7 days a week throughout Plymouth, Westland, Livonia, Northville, Garden City, and Farmington, MI. We dispatch technicians quickly, and our fully stocked vans are equipped to resolve most repairs right then and there.</p>

To maintain your license you will also be required to complete an approved code update course within one year of the state's adoption of a new version of the National Electrical Code. Installation costs $115 to $280 assuming that existing wiring can be used. And according to the Department of Consumer and Employment Protection', for the year 2006 to 2007 (present), there are 929 electric shocks, 22 serious electrical accidents, and 5 fatalities that occurred and have been reported.</p>
