<p>Interest in low voltage, or 12v, lighting has grown in our increasingly energy-conscious customers over the last several years, with the emergence and proliferation of long-life, energy-efficient lighting. I sprung for a $100 700W generator a few years ago, maybe another hundred bucks worth of parts, quality gas cans, and a propane camp stove. Make all connections at the fixtures using silicon filled wire connectors, stripping back the insulation a minimum of 1 inch.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of your requirements, our helpful and friendly electricians can discuss them with you to ensure you get the perfect standby generator to suit your electrical demands. A Cummins gasoline-powered portable is easy to move so you'll always have power where and when you need it.

We also have access to the latest in cutting-edge electrical panels along with all the expertise needed to install your ideal system. There are many different emergency house generators for sale and knowing your own power requirements will help with determining the most appropriate option.</p>

Turn the power back on. As you progress in replacing bigger and more complicated fixtures you may want to try installing a new fixture where one did not exist.
