<p>That do not have a grounding prong to protect against falling objects bridging hot and neutral. Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
<p>A light switch that draws inspiration from traditional Korean architecture (and clothing!)
