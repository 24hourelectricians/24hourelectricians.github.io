<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Contractor in Mauston</h2>
<p>You will benefit from using residential wiring diagrams if you plan on completing electrical wiring projects in your home. Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets. I keep the portable for when I do outside work at the back of our property (1+ acre) where running an extension to the house when using the electric trimmer doesn't work well due to the voltage drop.</p>

Journeyman (electrician) License: 4-year experience or completion of a department-approved training course + 2-year experience are required.

Licenses issued through the Department of Public Safety, Electrical Licensing, and Inspection.

And like all technicians, our licensed electricians are vigorously background checked to ensure you only get the most trusted, best electricians to help you with all your electrical needs. Direct other questions about licensing and examinations directly to the Electrical Administrative Office of the Bureau of Construction Codes.</p>
