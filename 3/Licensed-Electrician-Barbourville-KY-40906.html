<p>To keep your AC fit and fine at all times and to make it perform at its best, air conditioning maintenance is necessary. Touch-Plate® says that 3-Way, 4-Way and even 5-Way switching is a standard feature of low voltage control systems and almost all old Touch-Plate® installations have multiple switches that control the same relay.

Apart from protecting your equipments, the flush mount surge protector receptacle also provides protection to your operating personnel.</p>
