Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
