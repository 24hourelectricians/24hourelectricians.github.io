<p>If you need a bit cheaper and smaller generator to run only the most important appliances, check out Westinghouse WGen6000 instead.

Even in states that do not have contractor licensing requirements, financial incentive programs often include installer requirements, such as pre-approval or, some cases, NABCEP certification. The Generac standby generator senses outages and turns itself on within seconds when there's a utility power outage.</p>

Eco-conscious choices like CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs) and outdoor lights cost more and can run as high as $200 per light.
