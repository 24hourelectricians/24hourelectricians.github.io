Since the transformer is already plugged in, the fixture should light up. If it doesn't, pull apart the connector and try again, or check the lightbulb. You should consider the architecture of your house when choosing the style of the light fixture. Sharp prongs inside the connectors pierce the cable and make contact with the wires.</p>
<p>There are certain specifications for electrical outlets, especially in kitchens where microwaves and other major appliances are plugged. Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power.
