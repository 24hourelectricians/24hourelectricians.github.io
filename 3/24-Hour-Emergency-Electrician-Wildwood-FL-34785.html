Don't confuse this electrical wiring system with other low-voltage electrical systems in which everything is operating on low voltage (typically 24VAC): the switches, controls, and the electrical devices themselves.</p>
<p>Charging stations for electric vehicles can increase power consumption as much as 50 amps at 220 volts. After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>

But the catch is that, unlike an ordinary switch, some of these new switches require a neutral to operate correctly.</p>
