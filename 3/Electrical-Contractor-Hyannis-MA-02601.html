Circuit breakers that are old might not have enough capacity to keep up with today's needs, or you might even have a fuse box, which is an outdated system.</p>
<p>For example, current code dictates three-prong polarized receptacles and dictates the use of ground fault interrupters in locations where an electrical appliance may be dropped in water. When an electrical problem occurs, the 24-hour emergency service provided by Piper Electric Co., Inc. The experts at MX Electric have provided safe and efficient panel upgrades in Champaign for more than 20 years.

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box.
