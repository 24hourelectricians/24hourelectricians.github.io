Education: Residential electricians must obtain a high school diploma, engage in an apprenticeship program, attend classes, 8,000-10,000 hours of on the job experience and the pass a competency exam to then become licensed to perform their work.</p>

<p>Click Add a reminder‚Äù (right-hand margin) to request notification when it's time to renew your electrical contractor's license.

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires).
