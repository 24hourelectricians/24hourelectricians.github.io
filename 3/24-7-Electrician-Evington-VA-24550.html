With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security. However, choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is so stressful. Circuit breakers in the main panel cut power to individual circuits if they start to draw more current than is safe.</p>

Eaton has a comprehensive array of surge protective devices and suppressors to meet your needs ranging from residential to industrial applications.</p>

Pull the plug, not the cord, when disconnecting an electrical device. This flaw can lead to damage to the panel, breakers and home electrical devices, or cause a fire. This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
