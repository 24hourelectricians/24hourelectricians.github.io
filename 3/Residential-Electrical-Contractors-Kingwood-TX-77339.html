<p>Today, most homes have what is officially called the electrical service panel, or simply, the service panel. Check for a second hot wire also present in the same box. Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible. Finally, some households overuse power cords. Installing a low-voltage lighting system is both safe and inexpensive.</p>

Electrical panels do more than distribute electrical power to the many different devices thru your home, they protect you against electrical shorts and circuits overloads that can cause a fire.
