A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch. To start, the wiring from the outlet to the switch does not seem to carry the ground over; I can see it terminated at the end of the sheath right where it comes into the light switch box.</p>
<p>Follow the rules above for extension cords and triple taps, and apply common sense to your electrical needs overall. Reliability means you can be sure that the installed electrical systems will continue to perform for a long period of time and as they were designed. Never use electrical gadgets or appliances near water. I can only speculate as to why the writers of that rule included it, but without a neutral in the switch box, there is no legal or safe method starting a new circuit there.</p>
