AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>
<p>However, in some situations, it will be necessary for you to upgrade your electric panel to a more advanced system. For instance, LED bulbs do a better job of mimicking natural light than other bulbs, which makes your home feel more inviting and easier on the eyes.
