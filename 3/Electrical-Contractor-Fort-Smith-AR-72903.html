<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Fort Smith</h2>
<p>Electrical contracting is a massive industry valued at more than $130 billion annually. My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>Specialty Dual License Contracting, Electrical CR-11 - This license covers both residential and commercial electrical work. A spike or surge probably won't affect other big appliances, but it could harm tiny components in sensitive electronic equipment.
