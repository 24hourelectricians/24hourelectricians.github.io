You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
