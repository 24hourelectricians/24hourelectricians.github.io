<p>Electrical wiring for a new log home is always a thing that worries owners. In most cases, this will provide you with enough coverage to keep your most important appliances running, such as your refrigerator, but it will not power not your entire home. If for any reason you think your electric service is underpowered and you are not tripping breakers or blowing fuses, you should call us for an immediate inspection. These generators are powered by natural gas or propane and start automatically during power outages. There are foot measurement indicators that let you know how much cable you have left, it is weather resistant from the sun and moisture as well as oil resistant, and it has a long term life expectancy for all of your low voltage cable lighting.</p>
