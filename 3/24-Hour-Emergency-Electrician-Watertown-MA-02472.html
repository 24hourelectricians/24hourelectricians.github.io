Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency. If electric fault causes too much damage, the replacement of electrical wiring is necessary. As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>
<p>This and the increased electrical demands we have nowadays can lead to overheating of the wires creating a serious electrical fire hazard.
