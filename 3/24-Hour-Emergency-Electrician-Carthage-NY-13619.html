<p>Electrical maintenance contracts are often the source of irritation for many businesses. By using a larger fuse we may stop the problem of the fuse blowing all the time but the wire is rated to carry only 15 amps. To install a timer simply remove the plug from the outlet, insert the timer into the outlet, then re-plug the transformer into the outlet on the side of the timer. Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.

Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
