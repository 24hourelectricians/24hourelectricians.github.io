<h3>Why You Should Conduct An Electrical Audit Danville CA 94526</h3>
<p>The black wires are the power (or hot”) wires, the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires, and the bare copper wire is the ground wire.

It's for this reason, among others, that electrical maintenance is such an important part of commercial building operations.</p>
<p>You do not need to be an expert contractor to install your lighting system. And surge protection plays a more important role than ever before. Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>

<p>And remember, if you're unsure about an electrical outlet or appliance, always ask a professional to take a look and keep you and your family safe.
