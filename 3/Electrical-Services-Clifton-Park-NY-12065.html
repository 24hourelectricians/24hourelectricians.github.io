Enter the backup generator: your personal solution for short-term energy independence, making home life livable until your electrical service can be restored.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages.
