<p>Your old electrical panel box might also become a problem when you decide to sell your house. Target just the breakers that handle power for the light fixtures ( $205 at Amazon ) and switches you plan to service. Utility companies incur significant upfront costs to start supplying utility services by purchasing power and water equipment and installing a distribution network. If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>
