Aluminum wiring used in the 60s and 70s, non-metallic wiring installed in the 40s and 50s, and knob and tube wiring in pre-1930s homes are well-known safety hazards, as are loose connections and frayed wires resulting from wear-and-tear.</p>
<p>When purchasing or building a new home, lighting installation is often the least of your priorities. A grounding wire is connected separately to each outlet and then is connected to the bottom of the breaker box. Why not extend the landscape lighting to the exterior surfaces of the home as well.
