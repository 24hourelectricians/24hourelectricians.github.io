<p>An electrical and electronic installer is responsible for testing, operating and repair of equipment and tools that make use of electronic technology. This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation. Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GEÂ® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below.

<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away.
