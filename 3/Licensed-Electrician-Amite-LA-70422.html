<p>This involves determining the specific locations of each light and its outdoor power source. This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>
<p>In some instances, wiring colors are also applied in electrical wiring installation that does not adhere to the general rules of wiring. Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity.

Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>
<p>Generators should be placed far away from the house. Although it could cost $1,500 to $2,000 to replace a fuse box, you might need to if you plan to add circuits and wiring. Our electricians may install anything from fresh plugs in which you had none previously, outside lighting for your house or even a complete knob and tube replacement in the entire home or property. Also, a master electrician license is required. Choosing a certified, insured and licensed electrician for your electrical work is essential to ensuring the successful resolution of your electrical issues, and the safety of your home or business.</p>

Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
<p>The cost of not replacing your electrical panel may be much higher if your panel starts a fire. It has a multilingual LCD display to monitor generator status, check for any maintenance, and utility power presence. Whether you want to prepare for winter snow and ice storms or summer hurricanes, or just make sure your business never loses power throughout the year, Davis & Green Electrical is your source for quality generator installation and maintenance.
