<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Averill Park</h2>
<p>An electrical and electronic installer is responsible for testing, operating and repair of equipment and tools that make use of electronic technology. This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation.
