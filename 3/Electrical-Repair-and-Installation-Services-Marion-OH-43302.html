<p>Electrical wiring problems can potentially cause serious fire and electrocution hazards, so it's better not to take a chance if there is any question in your mind about safety. Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in. If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>

Limited Electrician - You must have completed an approved electrical study program of at least 576 hours. A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).
