The big distinction is that residential electricians work in buildings that are residences, single-family homes and small apartment buildings. Lighting not only represents the image of your company, but it enhances business and minimizes liability when in peak operating condition. Pros: Portable generators are cheaper to buy and install than home standby models.</p>

<p>You can go all out and buy the best you can afford, but you'll save some money by buying a surge protector appropriate for the equipment you'll use it with. The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks. I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work. The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
