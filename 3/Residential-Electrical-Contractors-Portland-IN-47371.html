Lighting not only represents the image of your company, but it enhances business and minimizes liability when in peak operating condition. Pros: Portable generators are cheaper to buy and install than home standby models.</p>

The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
