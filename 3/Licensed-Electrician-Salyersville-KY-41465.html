Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need. Connect all the fixtures and use a graph paper for calculation of the total length of wire that you need, which would be restricted to a maximum of 250W on a length of 12 gauge cable.

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box.
