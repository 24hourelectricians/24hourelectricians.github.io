A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).

Journeyman electrician license: You need to show evidence of 8,000 hours of installing electrical or heating equipment, power, light, wiring, or electrical apparatuses.
