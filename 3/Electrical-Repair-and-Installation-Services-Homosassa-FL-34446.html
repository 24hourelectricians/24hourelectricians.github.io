Limited Electrician - You must have completed an approved electrical study program of at least 576 hours. A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V). When a threshold is over 120V, a surge protector shorts to ground voltage or blocks the voltage.</p>
<p>A damaged or broken connection in the receptacle itself, or if the bottom receptacle opening was split-wired to be powered by a different circuit, that circuit may have an open wire or a tripped breaker or fuse - OR - it may have been wired to a light switch in the room.

Journeyman electrician license: You need to show evidence of 8,000 hours of installing electrical or heating equipment, power, light, wiring, or electrical apparatuses.
