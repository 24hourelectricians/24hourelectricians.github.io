However, choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is so stressful. Circuit breakers in the main panel cut power to individual circuits if they start to draw more current than is safe.</p>
<p>This and the increased electrical demands we have nowadays can lead to overheating of the wires creating a serious electrical fire hazard.
