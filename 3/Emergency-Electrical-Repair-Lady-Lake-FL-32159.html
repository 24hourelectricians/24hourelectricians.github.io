In addition, the requirements for where GFCI electrical outlet wiring must be installed have become more stringent over the years; to prevent the possibility of accidental electrocution, have a reliable electrical repair service ensure that any and all outlets located close to a source of water - both indoors and outdoors - are up to current code.</p>
