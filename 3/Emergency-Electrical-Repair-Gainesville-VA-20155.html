When John Michael Kohler founded his company in 1873, he had no way of knowing the positive impact his powerful products would have on people for generations to come.</p>
<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur. It would be smart for the Licensed Electrician to take some Industrial Electrician courses too, but if time is of the essence, the electrician may want to get PLC Troubleshooting training first.
