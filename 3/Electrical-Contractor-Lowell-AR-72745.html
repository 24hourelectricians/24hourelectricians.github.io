So, now that you know what type of switch you have, you can go to the store to get that you have a three-way switch, two the terminals are the same color, you will also have two wires coming from that old switch that you need to put on the same side and you will have a third wire that is a different color that will go on the darker colored terminal and again you have your ground terminal and that is where the green wire or bare wire goes.A couple of reasons you may need to replace your outlet.</p>
<p>We have a couple of portable generators that we can use for back-up. Obsolete electrical wiring such as knob and tube wiring does not necessarily have to be replaced (by code) but may be damaged, modified, or otherwise unsafe. If your wires are solid copper, create a loop in the end of the wire with the pliers and guide it around the screw on the side of the switch. Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>
