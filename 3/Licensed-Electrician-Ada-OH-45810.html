<p>Unseen, and often overwhelming, the average home has miles of wiring and cable running through it. While often used interchangeably, electrical wire and cable are different. Many surge protectors come with USB connections, so you can charge your mobile devices without having to use a their wall warts. By updating the panel and getting experienced advice on the state of your wiring, you can rest assured that your home's electrical system is safe. Since the generator is connected to your house's electrical panel, you don't need to go out and turn the switch on, connect extension cords, and connect it your home appliances.</p>
<p>A full electrical wiring inspection is the only way to know for sure where the problem originates. If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4.

Our welcoming staff will schedule residential or commercial electrical estimates and meet you on-site in order to assess the amount of work and materials needed in order to get the most accurate price.
