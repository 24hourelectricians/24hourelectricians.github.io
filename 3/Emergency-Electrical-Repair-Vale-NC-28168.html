<p>You could even add half hot outlets by using a 3 rope wire with black, red, white and green if you would like to. Two of my living room outlets, for instance, are operated from the same switch. I have another neighbor who leaves several safety lights on all night long. These tasks, though important, are only one of the many electricians might tackle.
