Having a generator on hand lends peace of mind in case of a weather emergency or other power interruption. Feel confident that AEC emergency electrical service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist you with all your emergency electrical needs.</p>
<p>A permanently installed standby generator, by contrast, is always ready to go and can run nonstop for days, fueled by a natural gas line, or tanks of propane or diesel. Therefore in order to prevent accidents caused by electrical wirings you must know the proper precautions to do on it. It should be spliced to another black in the box (from your description), with a short piece added to the splice to go to the switch.
