<p>Federal Pacific circuit breaker panels, with their faulty Stab-Lok breakers, still lurk in many older homes, says Volpe who replaces at least 300 each year.

<p>However, there may be local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check these before you begin work. Licenses are issued by the State Electrical Board of North Dakota.

Scope of the project - The cost of your electrical panel replacement will vary based on what you need done.</p>
