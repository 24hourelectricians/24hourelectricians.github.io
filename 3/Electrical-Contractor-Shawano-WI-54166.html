Larger generators, such as home standbys, are rated by kilowatt (kW), which measures the generator's electrical power output. Low-voltage system relays originally made by GEÂ® or Remcon cannot be replaced individually with newer ones from Touch Plate - there are electrical design differences that mean the products are not interchangeable.</p>

Sometimes, a lighting designer or a home owner will want to take advantage of voltage drop.</p>

The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family.
