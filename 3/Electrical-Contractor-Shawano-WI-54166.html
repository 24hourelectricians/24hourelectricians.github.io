Larger generators, such as home standbys, are rated by kilowatt (kW), which measures the generator's electrical power output. Low-voltage system relays originally made by GE® or Remcon cannot be replaced individually with newer ones from Touch Plate - there are electrical design differences that mean the products are not interchangeable.</p>
