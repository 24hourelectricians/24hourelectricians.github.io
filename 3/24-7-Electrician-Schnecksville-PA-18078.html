An APC surge protector is superior to the protective devices manufactured by its competitors for several reasons.</p>
<p>In case a situation arises, like a hurricane or other type of powerful storm, you'll be glad you had Guin Service install your generator because you know the job was done correctly the first time. Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you.

In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle.
