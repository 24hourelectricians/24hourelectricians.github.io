Take for instance, a home where there are senior citizens, small children or even a sick person; for such people, extreme heat variations, whether up or down on the thermometer, can result in life threatening extreme heat variations would only happen in a malfunctioning HVAC system, and this is something that would have been avoided altogether through properly scheduled electrical maintenance of all its components in a timely manner like say, before the onset of winter or summer.</p>
<p>Consequently, electricians with less than a year of experience make up just 2 percent of the workforce. Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle.
