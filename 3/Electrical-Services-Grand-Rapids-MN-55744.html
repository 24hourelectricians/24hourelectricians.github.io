A Journeyman electrician shall have eight thousand hours experience, which experience may not be obtained in less than three years, registered as an apprentice electrician (of which up to three thousand hours may apply under the qualifications of a class B electrician) under the supervision of a contracting master or master of record licensed electrician in an area where electrical construction work is done in the jurisdiction regulating similar licensing and inspection rules of the state of North Dakota, and successfully completed apprentice electrician training.</p>
