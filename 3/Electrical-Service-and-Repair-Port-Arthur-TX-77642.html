<p>There is however a sure fire way to make sure that the electrician you choose to hire is licensed is to ask for a copy of their current electrical license, or their license number.” - Always Hire a Licensed Electrician , Corrao Electric Co., Inc.

<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>
