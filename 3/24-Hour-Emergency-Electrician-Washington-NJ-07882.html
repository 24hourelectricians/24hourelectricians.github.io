The black wire is the "hot" wire, which carries the electricity from the breaker panel into the switch or light source.</p>
<p>You can access these circuit breakers and turn them on and off to restrict power to a particular circuit in your home. On the other hand, a generator that's too powerful for what you need will cost more to install and operate.
