<h3>What Does a Chevy Chase MD Residential Electrician Do?</h3>
<p>Since all your electrical power goes through the breaker panel, it's vital to ensure that the panel is working safely and efficiently. When the service panel starts to wear down, it becomes increasingly susceptible to power surges. An addition to your home or building, in the same area of your electrical meter, can be the cause for a new service location. We provide you with a comprehensive plan that will ensure that all types of electrical problems are resolved the right way, the first time, and you gain peace of mind.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
<p>If it is, though, you can make any or all of the outlets half hots. We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless. The result is damaging surges traveling to important electronics elsewhere in the house.</p>
