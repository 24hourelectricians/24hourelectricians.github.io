<p>Requirements vary, but usually call for the completion of an approved training program, work as a journey worker and passing a test on electrical codes. Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home. It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as £10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety).
