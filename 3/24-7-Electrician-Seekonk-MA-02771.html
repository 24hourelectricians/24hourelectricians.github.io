Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one. What ever your goals are it is best to make a plan and design your low voltage outdoor lighting system to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician. The power is reliably there and immediately so. Connecting lighting fixtures to low voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle to the end of a garden hose.

So, if your fixtures are each eighteen watts and you have ten of them, that is 180 watts for your transformer and 25% more for the wire.</p>
