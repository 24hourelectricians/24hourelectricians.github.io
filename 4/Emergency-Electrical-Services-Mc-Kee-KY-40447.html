<p>One way to do this is by teaching them about safety around electricity in your own home. Contact a licensed electrical contractor if you have flickering lights, sparks, non-functioning outlets, or need wiring repairs or upgrades.

High voltage power may be run to a central driver location ideally, within 50 feet of wire length from lighting, depending on the system and wire types), and then all wiring downstream of the drivers may be Class 2. Class 2 wiring does not need to be inside a conduit or junction box, nor does it need to be grounded.</p>
<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor. The most commos safety issue we see is when multiple circuits are installed under one fuse. During this time aluminum was a lot cheaper than copper and it conducted pretty similarly. You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>
