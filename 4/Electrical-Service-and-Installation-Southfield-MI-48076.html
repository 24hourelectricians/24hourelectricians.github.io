<p>Modern electrical code requires a neutral in every switch box, but that did not used to be the case and a great many switches do not have a neutral there. When purchasing a power cord, consider the electrical load it will carry. The hot source at the outlet is spliced to the black wire running to the switch and the hot wires running to the other outlets in the circuit. And whether the journeyman electrician candidate has acquired the desired skills, knowledge, and electrician training necessary to become a certified or licensed electrician.</p>
<p>You can also check out our selection of electrical wire terminals for related products that will help you make a complete electrical connection.
