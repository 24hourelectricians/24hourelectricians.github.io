<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs. Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions. However, homes not located on a gas service network use propane to fuel their standby generators. Generally, purchasing a good surge protector gives you the benefit of having lower electricity costs and better quality of your appliances.</p>
<p>Our method of installing switches and plugs is different from the methods used in new construction and takes more time, however you will never have problems caused by loose connections in the devices. Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector. If anything looks discolored, burned, or melted, turn off the power at your breaker box and call a qualified electrician immediately. While smart switches take a little more effort to install, they keep outlets available and can control more than one bulb.</p>
<p>Using surge protectors extends the life of appliances and electronics by as much as 30%. Alternative power generation, such as solar and wind, is an emerging field that should require more electricians for installation. We are happy to answer any questions you may have, and can also schedule a convenient time for you to meet a highly trained, experienced electrician in your area.
