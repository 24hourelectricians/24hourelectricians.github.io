I have not tried the drilling machine trick yet, but will doing so most likely before the weekend - I can say that this trick sounds totally logical and correct as when I was still at school and studied Electrical Technology and Auto Electrical principals, we were taught to use a battery, but as I don't have a low current battery ( torch batteries ) on hand without going to buy them specifically for this one time use ( our school always had 6 Volt or 9 Volt lantern batteries on hand for the hands-on class ( referring back to the early 1980's ), I cannot use a standard car battery as the amount of amps the car battery can supply through the low resistance stator coils will burn the stator of rotor coils out instantly.</p>
<p>Open and tag the power supply circuit for the outlet being replaced. Any outlet near water should be switched to code-correct GFCI outlets.

<h2>Backup And Emergency Power Pratt Kansas</h2>
<p>While our technicians specialize in Generac, we are able to provide regular generator maintenance services to any make or model generator.
