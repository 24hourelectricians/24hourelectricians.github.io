When there is more than one fault, the troubleshooting is exponentially more difficult, do not assume that all problems are solved after completing one, always test the circuit and operation prior to returning the equipment to service. Now that you know what types of generators are available, talk with a professional to help you decide whether a standby or portable one is right for you.</p>
