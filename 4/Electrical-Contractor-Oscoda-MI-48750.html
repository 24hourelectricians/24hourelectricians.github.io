GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water. While there are many different colors and types of materials being used within the solar lights, a flagstone pathway can be nicely illuminated with metal or copper lighting fixtures. However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace. If there is, try and add a short piece of black wire to the splice and put the other end onto the upper brass screw.</p>
