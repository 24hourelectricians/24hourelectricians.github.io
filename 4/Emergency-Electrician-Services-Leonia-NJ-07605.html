Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need.

<p>Today, most homes have what is officially called the electrical service panel, or simply, the service panel. Check for a second hot wire also present in the same box. Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible. Finally, some households overuse power cords. Installing a low-voltage lighting system is both safe and inexpensive.</p>
