Loosen the terminal screws at each side of the switch-outlet and detach the wires from each terminal by hand.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits. You can design your wire route so that it reaches each fixture and then returns to the transformer.
