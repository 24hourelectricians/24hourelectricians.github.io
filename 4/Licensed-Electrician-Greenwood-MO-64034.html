External power surges, on the other hand, occur when lightning strikes the electrical power line or a small animal gets into the transformer. Don't confuse this electrical wiring system with other low-voltage electrical systems in which everything is operating on low voltage (typically 24VAC): the switches, controls, and the electrical devices themselves.</p>
<p>A power outage in most households is simply an inconvenience as most people can stay in the dark for a few hours, a circuit overload, blown circuit or sparkling outlet, however, is an emergency.

<h2>Generator Repair & Replacement Greenwood Missouri</h2>
<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
