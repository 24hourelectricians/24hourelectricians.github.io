<p>Interest in low voltage, or 12v, lighting has grown in our increasingly energy-conscious customers over the last several years, with the emergence and proliferation of long-life, energy-efficient lighting. I sprung for a $100 700W generator a few years ago, maybe another hundred bucks worth of parts, quality gas cans, and a propane camp stove.
