<p>Low voltage outdoor path lighting systems, which use 12-volt electrical circuits to power the lights, are wired, as opposed to solar systems. Similar to NM cable, UF cable is made up of three wires.

Light switches and outlets in your home may not seem like a big to-do at first, but when it comes to your home's electrical system, their the point of entry for every single thing you need to do. Replacing these in older homes can be a hassle - but necessary - and keeping updated on your maintenance is vital for sustained ease of use and longevity.</p>

Renovation projects often include installing automated environmental controls, relocating electrical receptacles, upgrading electrical panels, and installing new lighting. Practice extension cord safety. Maglio Electric technicians install multiple outlets per room to meet your electrical needs and free you from unsightly extension cords and power strips.</p>
