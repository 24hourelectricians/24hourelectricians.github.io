These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>Requirements vary, but usually call for the completion of an approved training program, work as a journey worker and passing a test on electrical codes. Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home. It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as £10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety).

The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks. I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work.
