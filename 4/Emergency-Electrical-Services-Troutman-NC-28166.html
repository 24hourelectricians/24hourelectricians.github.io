<p>The easiest way to do this is to install an AFCI receptacle at the first receptacle outlet of the existing circuit. Standby generators can run on natural gas or propane. A transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold. As the wiring corrodes the flow of electricity is slowly decreased causing lights to burn dimmer. If you want outdoor lighting installed for your residential or commercial property, our team can help.</p>
<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
