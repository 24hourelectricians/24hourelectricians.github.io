<p>Our polite electricians will look after your property and needs with respect. Some smart switches will need wire connectors, but most have wire terminals.

After some time, the electrical panel becomes old or outdated. Every outlet in your home is designed to deliver a certain amount of electricity; by plugging too many devices into it at once, you could cause a small explosion or a fire.</p>

Our professional and reliable technicians provide upfront, flat-rate pricing before starting any work and we guarantee high-quality, on-time services with a labor guarantee.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
<p>Although single motors and single controllers are sometimes used in isolated applications, the more usual application is one in which many motors and many controllers are interlinked into a larger automated system that includes many types of processes. For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it.
