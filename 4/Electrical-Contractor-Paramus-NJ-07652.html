<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade.

Propane and petrol generators provide a safe, longer fuel supply and are significantly more environment-friendly than gasoline fueled generators.
