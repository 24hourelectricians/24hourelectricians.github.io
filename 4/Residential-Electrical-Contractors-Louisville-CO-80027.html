<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>The electricians listed below install whole-house surge protection devices. This is why it's very important to understand what a surge protector is and some of the benefits that it can offer you whenever the surge protector is installed directly onto your electric panel. Alternatively, you can splice two pigtails to the "hot wire" at the outlet and terminate one on each of the brass terminals so that each half of the outlet is using the same source of power.</p>
