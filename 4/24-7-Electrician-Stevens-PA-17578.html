<p>If you look through any surge protector reviews you will see countless types of surge protectors for every kind of appliance. The dim lighting means you have to use more fixtures, which creates a sort of landing strip look, or if you are using deck light fixtures they end up looking like a bunch of bug zappers, (without the ability to zap the bugs). The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>

<p>Labeling - If you are keen enough, you will find that electrical wires have letters on them.
