<p>Between 1999 and 2002, more than 30 percent of all employee compensation claims from the Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) were related to ergonomics. If the incoming ground wire from the feed circuit was left long enough, it can be run continuously, connected to a grounding screw that connects the wire to the metal junction box (skip this step if plastic junction boxes are in use), on to the ground screw terminal at each electrical receptacle, and ending with a ground clamp crimp connector that ties the incoming ground to the ground wire of the outgoing wire that continues to the next junction box.</p>
<p>An electrical fuse is essential for protecting your electrical system during surges and power fluctuations. In addition all of our contractors are licensed, bonded & insured. The National Electric Code (NEC) requires that low voltage power supplies and electrical wiring be Class 2 compliant.
