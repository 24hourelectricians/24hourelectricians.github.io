<p>An electrical technician who can systematically troubleshoot and safely repair their plant's equipment will ultimately add to their organizations' bottom line. A loose wire on one of the breakers; burnt contacts on the panel box, an overloaded circuit, or a worn out breaker, can cause the irregular noise. Never use extension cords under rugs or carpet, near high-traffic areas, wrapped around table or chair legs, through doorways or anywhere they can be pinched, flattened or severed. This is a new area for the Building Regulations and is called Part P (electrical safety). If you don't need to provide GFCI protection for other devices, or if the receptacle is at the end of the circuit (end-of-run), use only the LINE terminals, following the manufacturer's wiring diagram.</p>

<p>Master electricians must satisfy continuing education requirements at regular intervals - which also vary by state - to renew both types of credentials.

<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs. Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions. However, homes not located on a gas service network use propane to fuel their standby generators.
