We show you how the new wiring colours translate to the old electric wire colours and how you can ensure that the right wires are connected in any instance.</p>
<p>Defined simply, a joule is a measurement of how much energy transfers through electrical currents going back and forth between a wall outlet and a home appliance or entertainment device.
