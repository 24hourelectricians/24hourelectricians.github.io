<p>Riding lawn mowers are valuable and incredibly useful tools that can save time and energy spent on yard work. Portable generators can produce anywhere from 3,000 to 8,500 watts of power. Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency. If electric fault causes too much damage, the replacement of electrical wiring is necessary. As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>

Generally, the older wiring is, the more likely it is to be faulty, but having your electric panel inspected regularly by a professional electrician will identify any issues.</p>
