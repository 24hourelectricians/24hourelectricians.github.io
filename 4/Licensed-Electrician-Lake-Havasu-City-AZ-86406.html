Faster response - When utility power fails, KOHLER generators restore power to your home three times faster than competitive models. Here's some vital information to help ensure your safety around utility poles and power lines.

<p>With a whole home generator installed by our pros at Cardinal Heating & Air Conditioning, you never have to worry about losing power. Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems. A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>

Our electricians will treat your property as if it were their own, exercising caution and using the professional skill we are known for when completing a job. However, to contract, or offer to contract, to carry out electrical installation work, a licensed electrician must also be registered as an electrical contractor.</p>

This can prevent data and power loss during the transfer of power to the generator. You must have had a minimum of 8,000 hours of experience.</p>
<p>The neutral hole is connected to the wire that brings the electrical current back to the breaker box. 6. Perform continuity and resistance checks on relay coils and contacts, overloads, fuses, circuit breakers, switches and other control circuit components.
