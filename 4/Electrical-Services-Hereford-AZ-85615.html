You should have the white from the panel and a jumper from the black to the panel connected to the outlet, on opposite sides. If you did not snip the tab on the second (or third or fourth) outlet, it will cause all outlets on the circuit to remain hot all the time. Residential electrical contractors perform upgrades to home offices and home theaters.</p>
<p>This evaluation should include a thorough examination of the existing electrical service, electrical panel and wiring system. Your Breaker is Old - If your breaker box is old and the parts required for breaker repair are no longer available, it may be time to consider an upgrade. So, if a power surge occurs, the device will keep any harmful electrical currents from damaging your home devices. Periodically check casings for damage, and replace any frayed or cracked cords immediately.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
