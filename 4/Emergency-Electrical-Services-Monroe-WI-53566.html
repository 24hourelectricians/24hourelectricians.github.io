<p>Remember extension cords are intended to be temporary; they are not intended as permanent household wiring. The first step in troubleshooting an existing circuit that has developed trouble is to understand that circuit and to understand the operation of the machine it controls.

<p>If the 14-3 wires are the hot wires entering the box, and if only 14-2 is leaving the junction box, cap off the unused (typically the red) hot lead. Do not use light duty extension cords in a non-residential situation. Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011.
