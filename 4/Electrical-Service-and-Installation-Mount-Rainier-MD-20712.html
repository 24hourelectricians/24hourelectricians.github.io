<p>As we mentioned in a recent post, our members have been asking what the best engineering consulting firms to work for are, so this post covers some of the top electrical engineering companies to work for. An authorized Honeywell Generators dealer will discuss your home backup power needs with you so that they can recommend the best standby power system.

A journeyman license can be obtained after the successful completion of the apprenticeship program and passing the Electrical Journeyman exam.
