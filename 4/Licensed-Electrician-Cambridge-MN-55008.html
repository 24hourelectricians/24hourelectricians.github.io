To add a receptacle you need a proper hot, neutral and ground wire. When shopping for a standby generator, it is best to go through a certified generator dealer to ensure that a generator transfer switch is properly installed by a licensed electrician prior to generator installation.</p>

Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector. If anything looks discolored, burned, or melted, turn off the power at your breaker box and call a qualified electrician immediately. While smart switches take a little more effort to install, they keep outlets available and can control more than one bulb.</p>
