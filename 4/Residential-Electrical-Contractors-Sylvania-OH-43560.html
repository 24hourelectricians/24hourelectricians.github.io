<p>Turn OFF electricity at the main fuse box (or the circuit breaker box) that controls the power to the fixture or the room you're working in. Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
<p>The ground pigtail goes to the green ground screw on the switch. Ring Smart Lights can be also grouped together so that when one Ring Smart Light detects motion, it can activate an entire lighting group to illuminate a pathway or light up your entire yard. If it's not working properly or it needs to be expanded, our professional electricians can install a new panel that will exceed your state and local regulations.
