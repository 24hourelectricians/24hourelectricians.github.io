The main component for distributing safe voltage to all landscaping lights is the transformer. With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security.

Electrical Contractor License: There are numerous municipalities that require electrical contractor licensing. At peak power, it will return 22,000 watts of power if it's running on propane, and a very respectable 19,500 watts if it's burning natural gas. In some cases, you may have special circumstances that turn a routine electrical issue into one that needs urgent attention.</p>

In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
