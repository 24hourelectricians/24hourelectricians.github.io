<p>Quick connection points on back of outlet fail frequently with cheap electrical devices. The use of 12 or 10-gauge main cable increases efficiency and allows you to either place greater loads on your home runs or to use a lower voltage tap, in effect giving you the ability to increase voltage to existing fixtures in the future or to add more fixtures to that run without having to install a new home run cable. When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
