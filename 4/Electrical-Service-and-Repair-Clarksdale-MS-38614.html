A burning candle left unattended or grease splattering across a hot burner on the stove are obvious fire dangers, but another major contributor to household fires is electricity.

Your older home has a fuse block panel or split-bus panel, which do not have a main breaker.</p>

Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need. Connect all the fixtures and use a graph paper for calculation of the total length of wire that you need, which would be restricted to a maximum of 250W on a length of 12 gauge cable. It's important to note that different states and local governing bodies will have different sets of licensing requirements for electricians Some states will require more extended periods of working under a journeyman electrician which can influence when and how an apprentice can become authorized to wire either commercial or residential buildings.</p>

Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home.

<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
