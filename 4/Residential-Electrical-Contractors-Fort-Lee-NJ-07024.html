<p>At ElectricMan we can professionally replace your residential or commercial electrical panel. Whether you're a contractor or building manager, it is important to keep Class 2 compliance in mind when retrofitting or creating new construction with low voltage LED lights and systems. Ignoring these signs can result in serious and costly consequences that range from a burnt power outlet, melted electrical wiring, or damage to plugged-in devices to more serious risks like deadly electrocution and electrical fires. All outdoor outlets should have waterproof covers.</p>
