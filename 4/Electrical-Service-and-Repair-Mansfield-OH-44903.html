<p>Finally, prepare for the possibility of an electrical fire by purchasing a fire extinguisher specially designed for electrical fires.

In this course, the trainee will learn about the basic operation of an AC motor as well as its parts and functions.</p>
<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket.
