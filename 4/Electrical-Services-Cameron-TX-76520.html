Be on the lookout for power lines when using a chainsaw or other outdoor equipment. All surge protectors have a specified response time, this means the period of time in which the surge protector does not stabilise the voltage levels, obviously, the higher the response time then the greater the risk to the appliance in question.</p>

<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
