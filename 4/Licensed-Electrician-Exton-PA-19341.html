<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed. Being licensed means that an exam has been passed and the necessary qualifications to do the work is guaranteed. Lastly, remove the ground wire from the green screw.

If rewiring becomes necessary, develop a wiring layout with help from local electrical specialists.</p>
