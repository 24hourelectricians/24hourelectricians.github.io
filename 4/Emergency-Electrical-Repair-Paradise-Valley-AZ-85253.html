<p>At ElectricMan we can professionally replace your residential or commercial electrical panel. Whether you're a contractor or building manager, it is important to keep Class 2 compliance in mind when retrofitting or creating new construction with low voltage LED lights and systems.

Obsolete electrical wiring such as knob and tube wiring does not necessarily have to be replaced (by code) but may be damaged, modified, or otherwise unsafe. If your wires are solid copper, create a loop in the end of the wire with the pliers and guide it around the screw on the side of the switch. Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>

Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
