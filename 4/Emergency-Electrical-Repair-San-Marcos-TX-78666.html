Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>
<p>Journeyman Election: Completion of an approved residential apprenticeship program. That might sound obvious but the freedom of movement that portable generators offer is truly a wonderful thing.
