To handle increased electrical requirements, it's likely you'll also need to upgrade electrical wiring, especially if your house is more than 40 years old. While you don't need a degree to get into this career, electricians can find employment with the completion of an apprenticeship or some postsecondary training. This method of determining size is fraught with problems as the ratings of breakers, fuses and panels may correlate to the size of the electrical service, but in many cases they don't.</p>

<p>With a whole home generator installed by our pros at Cardinal Heating & Air Conditioning, you never have to worry about losing power. Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems. A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>
