<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow.

<p>A resistor-based surge protector for telecommunications cables. Remember, extension cords are temporary and should not be used as a replacement for permanent wiring,” says Dwayne. Landscape Lighting Low Voltage fixtures have become the norm in landscape lighting. One indication of a service that is undersized for the demands applied to it is the blowing or popping of the main fuses or breaker switch. Faulty equipment may indicate unsafe wiring. According to the National Fire Protection Association, an average of 53,000 electrical home structure fires occur each year, claiming more than 450 lives, injuring more than 1,400 people, and causing more than $1.4 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association, 2002-2006).</p>
<p>Many states require seven years of experience as an electrician or a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering for certification as a master electrician. It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>
<p>You can change the look of the lighting simply by changing the lens that is used on the light fixture. Having a certified, licensed electrical contractor can determine if you need to upgrade. AMP® Lighting in-house engineers led the design efforts to produce AMP® One technology - the industry's smartest approach to landscape lighting fixture control. If it signals there is still electrical current present after you've turned the breaker off, you may have to turn power to the entire house off and proceed with a battery powered light or call an electrician.</p>
<p>You should also consider the wattage of the fixtures to stay within the capacity of the transformer. When planning lighting to go around seating areas keep the deck light fixtures relatively low. Decorative fixtures will be placed in plain sight; otherwise, conceal the light source when possible. After mending the problem, the electrician can also work out the source of the problem and evaluate your electrical panel wiring to determine what needs to be done to prevent similar circumstances in the future.</p>
