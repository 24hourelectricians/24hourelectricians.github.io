<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead).

Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>Diesel generators are also time tested and have, over the years, also proven them to be very effective and reliable in generating electricity in times of power outages.

Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
