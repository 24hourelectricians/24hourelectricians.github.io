<p>Many fires are started by extension cords because they are used improperly, tied in knots, overloaded, stowed under rugs and carpet, used for circuit wiring, frayed or cracked or otherwise compromised. Landscape lights are also available in different voltages - 12 volt and 120 volt. Education: Residential electricians must obtain a high school diploma, engage in an apprenticeship program, attend classes, 8,000-10,000 hours of on the job experience and the pass a competency exam to then become licensed to perform their work.</p>
<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
<p>We have our super star technicians on-call 24 hours a day, ready to be dispatched to your home or business. Brett Brenner is president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI).

This National Electrical Safety Month (NESM), the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) is increasing public awareness of electrical hazards in both the home and in the workplace with its Be in the Know about the New” NESM consumer awareness campaign and the newly released How Do You Know?” workplace safety awareness program.</p>
