Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
<p>Electricians may need to take classes to learn about changes to the National Electrical Code, and they often complete regular safety programs, manufacturer-specific training, and management training courses. A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping.

You do get what you pay for when comes to surge protectors. Your electrical contractor, and the contractor's employees, should be licensed in the jurisdiction in which your project is located. Journeyman Electrician - You must have completed an approved apprenticeship program or you must show proof of at least 8,000 hours of practical experience or you must have worked in the electrical maintenance field for at least 20,000 hours.</p>
