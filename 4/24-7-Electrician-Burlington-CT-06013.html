Electrical appliances - kids these days have numerous electrical devices such as music players, portable TVs and computers, so they need to know how to use them responsibly, how always to switch them off at the wall when not in use, how to unplug them by the plug rather than the cord, how not to overload power points and to always make sure their hands are dry before touching appliances or light switches.</p>
