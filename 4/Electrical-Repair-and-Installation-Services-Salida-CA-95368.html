Obsolete electrical wiring such as knob and tube wiring does not necessarily have to be replaced (by code) but may be damaged, modified, or otherwise unsafe. If your wires are solid copper, create a loop in the end of the wire with the pliers and guide it around the screw on the side of the switch. Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>
<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed. Being licensed means that an exam has been passed and the necessary qualifications to do the work is guaranteed. Lastly, remove the ground wire from the green screw. Use extension cords or equipment that is rated for the level of amperage or wattage that you are using. Our electricians are true professionals.
