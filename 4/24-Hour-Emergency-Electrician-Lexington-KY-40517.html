<h3>Surge Protection And How It Works Lexington KY 40517</h3>
<p>A resistor-based surge protector for telecommunications cables. Remember, extension cords are temporary and should not be used as a replacement for permanent wiring,‚Äù says Dwayne. Landscape Lighting Low Voltage fixtures have become the norm in landscape lighting. One indication of a service that is undersized for the demands applied to it is the blowing or popping of the main fuses or breaker switch. Faulty equipment may indicate unsafe wiring. According to the National Fire Protection Association, an average of 53,000 electrical home structure fires occur each year, claiming more than 450 lives, injuring more than 1,400 people, and causing more than $1.4 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association, 2002-2006).</p>

<p>While the origins of a residential, commercial and industrial electrician may be the same or similar, the professions are vastly different. Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
<h3>Importance of Using a Lexington KY Licensed Electrician</h3>
