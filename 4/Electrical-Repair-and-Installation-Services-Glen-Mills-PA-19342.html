<p>In most cases, solar is a specialty classification under the general electrical or plumbing licenses and all appropriately licensed contractors can install solar systems without the solar specialty license.

In this article series we list common old building electrical wiring system safety concerns and we illustrate types of old electrical wires and devices.

In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
