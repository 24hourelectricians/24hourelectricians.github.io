A common mistake is to get the largest unit available to power the entire house. Many electricians consider old panels that have been manufactured by Zinsco and FPE to be very problematic. This could involve isolating components and evaluating their circuit parameters or isolating the circuits by group when dealing with a complicated circuit.</p>
