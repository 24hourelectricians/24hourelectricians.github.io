Outweigh the risks of such a specialised electrical job and don't try to fix the problem yourself. Ground wires are bare copper wires. Manufacturing and production facilities have power needs that are far different from the general needs encountered in other avenues of the electrical profession.

Your panel is also known as your fuse box, fuse panel, or circuit breaker panel, and is designed to trip and shut off when too much current flows through one particular circuit. A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch.
