The professionals at Turn It On Electric know to shut off the power before doing any type of electrical work. The increased cost of fuel oil and all precious metals has caused many manufacturers of electrical equipment to inventory less than ever before, and in some cases, major electrical items needed for emergency electrical services and repair such as power transformers and high voltage switchgear are made-to-order with lead times between 20 and 50 weeks.</p>
<p>Defined simply, a joule is a measurement of how much energy transfers through electrical currents going back and forth between a wall outlet and a home appliance or entertainment device. Keep hairdryers, curling irons, electric razors, electric toothbrushes and other appliances away from water. Large appliances like refrigerators, stoves, window air conditioners, washers and dryers should never be plugged in with extension cords or power strips. Either remember this in your head or mark the wires with electrical tape.</p>
