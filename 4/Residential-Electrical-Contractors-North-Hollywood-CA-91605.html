<p>It is common for landscape lighting to stop working and usually a simple repair can bring yard lights back to life. Tracing electrical wiring in walls can be tricky, and it involves more than just looking for the wires themselves. For the most stunning effects, go with a landscape lighting specialist familiar with the various fixtures and ways to arrange them.

Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch.
