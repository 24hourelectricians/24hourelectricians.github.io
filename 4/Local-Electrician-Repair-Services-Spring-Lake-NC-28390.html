The following products, with unique combination of features, are some of the most appreciated by electrical contractors: PTE-100-C, RAPTOR System, MENTOR 12, PME-500-TR, PRIME 600, PME-20-PH, GOOSEMeter One; all of them are a world leader and reference in their specific applications (primary injection, secondary injection, breaker testing, transformer testing, relay testing, etc), and they are must-have instruments for the wide diversity of electrical contractor services.</p>
