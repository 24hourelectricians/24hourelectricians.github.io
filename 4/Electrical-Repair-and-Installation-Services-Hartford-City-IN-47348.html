<p>In the heat of summer, many manufacturers worry about the lifeblood of their facility and manufacturing equipment - the electrical system. Landscape lighting is a great deterrent to thieves who thrive under the cover of darkness. Also, replace any frayed power cords on electrical appliances you use.

Whole house generators allow even very large homes with high power use to keep things running smoothly no matter what happens to the public power grid.</p>
<p>If you're adding lights at the same time you're doing new landscaping, it can cost less for the lights. The big distinction is that residential electricians work in buildings that are residences, single-family homes and small apartment buildings.

Most gardens will be amply illuminated by a maximum of 500 watts for security and 40 to 100 watts for lighting up a small area such as a doorway.</p>

The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks.

The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
