When you have a panel full of light switches, it can be challenging to remember which is which. Note that it is only the ‘live' wire that is connected to the switch, the ‘neutral' wire is not cut at all and the ‘earth' wire is connected to the ‘earth' terminal on the back box and on the switch if there is bare exposed metal.</p>

The electrician in charge is typically required to be a master electrician or a similarly senior electrician in states with no master licenses. Electrical breakers that trip frequently need troubleshooting and should be repaired to remedy this dangerous situation.
