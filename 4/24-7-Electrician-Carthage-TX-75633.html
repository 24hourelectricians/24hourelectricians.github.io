This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation.

<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur.
