<p>This component feeds electrical power to operate the low voltage switches and relays in the system. To check an electrician's licensing, refer to the Angie's List License Check tool You should also protect yourself by verifying the hold the appropriate bonding and insurance, including general liability and workers' compensation coverage.

<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ). The tabs held the box flush with the drywall and kept it from falling in while I screwed them into the studs.
