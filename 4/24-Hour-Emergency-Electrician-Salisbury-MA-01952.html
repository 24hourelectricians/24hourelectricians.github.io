<p>PART 1 OF 2: In this video, Master electrician Scott Caron shows the first phase of replacing an antiquated electrical system. If your home has two-prong outlets, there's no safe way to update them to modern three-prong outlets, short of calling a licensed electrician. You see, solar lighting runs purely off the power it draws from the sun during the day. In many cases, putting in a spa or sauna requires a dedicated electrical circuit, and this should be handled by a licensed professional. Working as anelectrician is one of the best jobs you can secure with only a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p>Homeowners can stay safe by following municipal guidelines that require new swimming pools to be installed by licensed professionals, and by ensuring that any power sources near the pool be GFCI outlets to minimize the risk of electric shock.

If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
