<p>If you are considering a solar powered generator, expect to pay anywhere between $300 and $5,000. Most extension cords aren't built to handle high-powered items such as air conditioners, refrigerators, or space heaters. For internal surface installation switches shall be provided with matching steel box and shall be with metal clad finish.
