Homeowners whose houses still use fuse box panels may want to upgrade to breakers.</p>

<p>Inspect all electrical appliances, such as vacuum cleaners, to ensure they're properly grounded. Every day, all around the world, people depend on technology, transportation, energy and infrastructure to live, work and thrive.
