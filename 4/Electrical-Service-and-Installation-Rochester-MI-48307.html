<p>Although electrical malfunctions can be inconvenient, our professionals make the repair process as pleasant and painless as possible. And if your lights don't work, no amount of creativity or planning will save your landscape lighting design. If you find a warm or hot outlet, shut the circuit off at the breaker box and call an electrician immediately. Our team has extensive experience with electrical installation and wiring, and we'll work hard to make sure your electrical wiring will be nothing less than perfectly configured.</p>

<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
<p>After you have determined which wire is the hot power wire, be sure to turn the electricity back off at the breaker box.

<p>There are many reasons why you may want to install or upgrade your outdoor lighting. Again this is just a general rule of thumb for most electrical house wiring.
