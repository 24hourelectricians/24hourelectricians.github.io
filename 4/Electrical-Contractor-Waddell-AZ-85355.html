The Electrician Training course is designed to teach you general and electrical safety procedures, use of common hardware and materials used in an electrical system, how to read and understand building plans, and more. Throughout our history, we have delivered some of the largest electrical infrastructure and notable commercial and industrial projects, and have been consistently recognized as one of the top five specialty electrical contracting firms by Engineering News-Record.</p>
<p>Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>Circuits are not designed to house two conductors, and one may come loose, overheat, arc, or even lead to a fire. With recessed lighting fixtures installed by a Sears Handyman, your home will enjoy a new touch of elegance that modern lighting provides.
