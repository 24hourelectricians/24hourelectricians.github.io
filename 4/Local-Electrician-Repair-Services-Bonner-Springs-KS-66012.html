<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Bonner Springs</h2>

It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything. The white wire is commonly used as the LINE down to the switch and must be re-indentified with a different color to indicate that. Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch.
