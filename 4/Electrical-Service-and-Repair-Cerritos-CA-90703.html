In other jurisdictions, you would be considered fully licensed and wouldn't even require the general oversight of a master electrician. When you need a certified, experienced, and prompt residential electrician in Maryland, Washington, DC, or Northern VA, contact Kolb Electric Family owned and operated since 1925, our team of expert, professional residential electricians have been trusted for many years to complete all types of residential jobs throughout the area.</p>

<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot.

Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>
<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later. The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>
