There are many reasons why home and business owners may need to replace their existing electrical panels. This course introduces the fundamental principles of electrical theory as applied to electrical circuits and devices such as transformers, inductors, and capacitors.</p>
<p>In a typical home, these events occur on a regular basis; they can damage unprotected devices instantly or over time.
