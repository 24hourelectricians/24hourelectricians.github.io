<p>The electrical code requires you to have GFCI outlets installed in bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor areas because these areas often get wet. The condition of cables and wires deteriorates over time. In addition, the rise of alternative energy systems like solar power means more growth in the need for electricians. Like anything in your home, however, breakers and fuses need to be repaired or replaced over time. These are hooked to your home's electrical system and directly take the required natural gas or propane fuel from your city's pipelines.</p>
<p>TPC Trainco provides live training for maintenance personnel in industrial plants and large facilities. This should be handled professionally as it involves permits, building codes, and professional electrical, plumbing and potentially gas line work if your power source is natural gas. When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>

Topics covered in classes can vary and might include: electronics concepts such as voltage and amperage; the science and design of pumps and mechanical motors; pneumatics and compressors; the heating and cooling cycles; and the properties of different metals, chemicals, and elastomers.</p>
