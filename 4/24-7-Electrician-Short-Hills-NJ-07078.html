Given that, I'd check the wiring at both switch and outlet. One of the first things to consider when installing a generator in your home is what type of fuel source you want it to run on. When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>
<p>Portable gas engine generators cost between $300-$2,500 and provide from 2,500-10,000 watts of emergency power. Backup home generators are the only reliable protection against a power outage. The wiring's thickness determines the brightness of all of your landscape lights. There may be no tell-tale signs of bad wiring, overloads, or surge damage, making professional electrical inspections so important. These wires are more effective in reducing electrical interference, which makes them efficient for telephone cabling.</p>

Some electrical work is fine to DIY, but a licensed electrician should do big jobs like replacing an electrical panel. Your home is outfitted with hundreds of lighting fixtures designed to provide light and comfort when it's dark.
