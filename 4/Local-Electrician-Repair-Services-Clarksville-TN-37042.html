<p>When doing auto electrical repair, the first vehicle component your should acquire knowledge about is the car battery. I believe the man leading the installation was Keith, and he did a terrific job to make sure the generator and the associated lines for the gas and electric outside the house were clean, neat, and actually looked good.
