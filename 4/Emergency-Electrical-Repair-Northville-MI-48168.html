It is usually near the point where wires enter the house. Installing an electrical box indoors or outdoors costs the same, about $800 to $4,000, depending on the amperage.</p>
<p>If the ceiling lights dim when you turn on a microwave or vacuum cleaner , you may be overloading the circuits or the wiring. Yanking can damage or fray the cord and compromise electrical safety. One of the causes of these fires is electrical malfunction.
