This book is a collection of hard-earned safety standards that many have given their lives so that you and I can reap the benefits of electric power. Never touch the bus bar inside an electrical service panel unless the main breaker has been turned off or the main fuse removed. One of the dangers of PVC wiring is that if there are a lot of wires confined in a small area, this may lead the wires to overheat.</p>

It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights.

Electricians are skilled at reading blueprints and technical diagrams, figuring out the best methods for installing new wiring, replacing old systems, identifying problems through the use of the proper devices, and following all state and local building and safety codes.</p>
