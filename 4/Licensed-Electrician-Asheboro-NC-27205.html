If it still doesn't light you have an electrical problem and this should be referred to your local mechanic. You might need to update your breaker box, add a subpanel, or upgrade some of your electrical wiring. Limited Residential Electrician - You must have completed an approved apprenticeship program in Oregon or you must have 288 hours of classroom training and 4,000 hours of on-the-job training or experience, or you must have 8,000 hours of experience from outside Oregon.</p>
