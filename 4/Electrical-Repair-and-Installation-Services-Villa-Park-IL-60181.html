The completed projects gallery can be filtered according to the type of service.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>

This includes all residential and commercial services, from bonding and grounding to generator installation and repair.</p>
<p>This eliminates the protection grounded cords afford to you. The engine delivers 10,000 watts of power on liquid propane and 9,000 watts on natural gas.
