If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
<p>The green or bare copper (ground) wire, if the device has one, attaches to the green screw terminal on the switch or to the electrical box.

Before you hire an electrician , one of the first things you should do is check to make sure that the electrician you have in mind is licensed in your state to practice either commercial or residential electrical work, depending on your job.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the switch leg of the circuit, from the switch to the outlet, may be white, and the yellow wire spliced to it in order not to have a white wire on the brass screws.
