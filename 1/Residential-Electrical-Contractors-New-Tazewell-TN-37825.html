<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire.

<p>Know the details of your project, as some electricians may specialize in certain types of electrical work.

For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
