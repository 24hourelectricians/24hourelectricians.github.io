<p>Two Lutron decorator-style rocker switches and wiring (often called "Decora switches", after the trademarked Leviton switches 1 ), as installed in the United States.

It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.
