We provide quality installed backup generators, maintenance and repair services to keep both your home and business protected.

Our electricians will treat your property as if it were their own, exercising caution and using the professional skill we are known for when completing a job. However, to contract, or offer to contract, to carry out electrical installation work, a licensed electrician must also be registered as an electrical contractor.</p>
<p>Electrical contracting services for residential and commercial clients. Electricians know that glossing over details in a wiring project could at best result in non-functioning wiring, and at worst create a dangerous situation. A lightning surge protection device creates a barrier that prevents electricity from spiking suddenly during a storm. In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>

<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket. You want people driving by to take a second look because what you've created is interesting,” says Chris Mitchell of landscape lighting firm NiteLiters in Owensboro, Ky. To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling. Avoid placing power cords close to electric devices that emit heat.</p>
<p>Either splice two short "jumpers" to the permanently hot wire and terminate one on each of the brass screws or simply replace the outlet with one that has not had the tab broken out.
