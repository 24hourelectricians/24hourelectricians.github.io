<p>Journeymen electricians have completed several years of on-the-job training and acquired the appropriate license in their state. Other outlets cannot be on the same circuit. Additional costs for replacement electrical panel installations: may be expected where there is difficulty of access, where demolition and wall repair are needed, where the electrical service is being upgraded to a larger ampacity than that of the panel being replaced, or where there are other special requirements.</p>

That is, if any other motors are running on the circuit beyond the blown fuse. NEVER use electrical equipment when barefooted.

If they are hot both ways, it is likely that the screws are connected internally, and you cannot switch just half of the outlet.</p>
