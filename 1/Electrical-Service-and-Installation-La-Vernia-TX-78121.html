You may not be able to tell which wires feed the outlet and which go on to another outlet, but it really doesn't matter so long as the black and white wires are connected as described above. Loosen the terminal screws at each side of the switch-outlet and detach the wires from each terminal by hand.</p>
<p>If necessary, loosen the screws a half-turn and align the switch-outlet vertically by hand, then tighten the screws. If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire.
