However, sometimes issues crop up at especially difficult hours, like long after or before typical business hours. You can think of voltage as a measure of electrical pressure. AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>

Having to throw away all of your food and replace it all is not only costly (not to mention an annoying and time consuming task), but if you're in a situation where you're trapped in your home for a few days because of the weather, you're going to depend on the food you have until you can safely leave your house.
