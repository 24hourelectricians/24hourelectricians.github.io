From there, circuits carry all the needed electricity to the appliances, lights, and outlets in your home. An electrical sub panel - also known as a service sub panel or circuit breaker sub panel - is often required to create new space for circuit breakers and to optimize your electrical system.</p>
<p>Follow the rules above for extension cords and triple taps, and apply common sense to your electrical needs overall. Reliability means you can be sure that the installed electrical systems will continue to perform for a long period of time and as they were designed. Never use electrical gadgets or appliances near water.

Rick's answer: I'm glad that sales person talked you into buying the surge protector, Anna. Circuit breaker installation or upgrade is a simple way of keeping you and your property safe.
