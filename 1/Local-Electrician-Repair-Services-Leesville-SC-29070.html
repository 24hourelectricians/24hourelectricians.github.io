Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians.

Circuits become overloaded when there is too much demand placed on your home's electrical system. When deciding where to place lights, you need to assess the elements on your property such as trees, flower beds, statues and walkways.</p>
<p>Do insert cord plugs fully into the power outlet. When you consider that every year around 6700 fires are reported as having an electrical source, you can see just how important electrical safety really is. This statistic includes fires started by faulty or inadequate wiring. A two-year post-high school electrical course with a degree in electrical technology can substitute for one year of experience.
