<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Durham</h2>
<p>Mr. Electric provides only the highest-quality service. That's exactly what Schneider Electric does with the ‘Connected Power' badge within the EcoXpert partner program: help electrical contractors tap into the clear benefits by training them in acquiring these skillsets and, at least as important, understand the existing connected power solutions such as smart panels, smart metering and the energy management and efficiency systems in the cloud , which make all the difference from the contractor, customer and optimization and services perspective.</p>

<p>Electricians need to be strong enough to move heavy components, which may weigh up to 50 pounds. Be wary of items purchased outside or imported into the UK, as these don't always meet national safety standards, and definitely avoid counterfeit electrical goods (such as off-brand hair straighteners), which are the leading cause of electrical shocks and fires. Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
