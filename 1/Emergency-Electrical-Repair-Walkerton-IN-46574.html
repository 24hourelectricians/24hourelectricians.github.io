If you're a renter with two-prong outlets, and your home or apartment was built or retrofitted after grounding became required in the 1960s, your landlord may be required to update the outlets at his or her own expense.</p>
<p>Adding 2 more conductors to add a higher-up outlet might take the standard box out of code, unless the lower box is box covered up and the outlets moved for no net change in conductors. We offer various options, including different fuel sources like propane or natural gas, different cooling methods such as liquid-cooling or air-cooling, and a whole range of different sizes and power outputs.
