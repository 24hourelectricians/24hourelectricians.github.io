<p>They require professional installation and either a natural gas or liquid propane fuel source. Low-voltage lighting is versatile because you can mix any fixture types you want along the same transformer line, from patio wall lights to walkway lights. During a power outage, run a cord from the backup generator to the inlet, flip a manual transfer switch on the subpanel, and all the designated circuits will have power.
