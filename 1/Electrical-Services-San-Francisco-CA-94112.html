After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses.

<p>Overheating wires can be a fire hazard and should be investigated by a 4 Service Pro electrician to identified the problem. Standby generators are great additions to any home or business. You may not be able to tell which wires feed the outlet and which go on to another outlet, but it really doesn't matter so long as the black and white wires are connected as described above. Loosen the terminal screws at each side of the switch-outlet and detach the wires from each terminal by hand.</p>

A service panel upgrade to 100 amps costs $850 to $1,600, a 200-amp breaker box replacement costs $1,800 to $2,500, and a 400-amp electrical service upgrade costs $2,000 to $4,000. One of the main factors to consider when deciding between hiring a lighting professional or doing it yourself is the scope of the design. If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>
