<p>You can be sure that we will give you the best 24 hour emergency electrical services in Denver and treat you fairly. Recent Review: This the second time we have called Gabe to perform electrical work for us and everything was completed as promised.

Some of the above can be used either for low voltage or 110 voltage, but you have to be certain you buy the proper light for the voltage it is wired for.
