Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
<p>Before purchasing, make sure a trained technician visits your home to assess your power needs, living area cubic footage, home electrical system, appliances, and possible installation issues. Installing a home backup generator is a great way to improve emergency preparedness in your household and keep your family comfortable in the case of a natural disaster or power outage.
