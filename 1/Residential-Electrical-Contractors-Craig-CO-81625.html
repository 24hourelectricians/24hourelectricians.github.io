<p>Outlets that are improperly installed can cause your circuit breaker to trip frequently. Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area. Your electrical panel box is a series of wires and breakers that dictate where power goes in your home or business and how much goes to each location.
