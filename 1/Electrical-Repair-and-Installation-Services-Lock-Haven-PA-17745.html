Manufacturing and production facilities have power needs that are far different from the general needs encountered in other avenues of the electrical profession. During scheduled maintenance or on construction sites, electricians should expect to work overtime. The low voltage cable lighting is ideal for outdoors it can also be made as a temporary arrangement.</p>

The dim lighting means you have to use more fixtures, which creates a sort of landing strip look, or if you are using deck light fixtures they end up looking like a bunch of bug zappers, (without the ability to zap the bugs). The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>In the UK you cannot mix outlets and lights on the same circuit but I don't know if this is permitted in Spain.
