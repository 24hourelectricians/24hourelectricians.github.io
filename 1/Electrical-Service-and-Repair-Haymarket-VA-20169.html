<p>Tip: If a project calls for longer lengths of wire (such as 80 or more feet from the breaker), increase the gauge size to ensure that enough electricity can pass through it. We specialize in comprehensive electrical wiring services for every aspect of your residential or commercial property. Your first step in adding backup power is deciding what you need (or want) to keep running when the electricity goes out. Our expert installers seamlessly integrate your generator into your home or business electrical network, thoroughly test your system, and stand behind your unit after the sale.</p>
<p>Electricians should also offer fuseboard upgrades to further enhance the safety of your electrics. The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
