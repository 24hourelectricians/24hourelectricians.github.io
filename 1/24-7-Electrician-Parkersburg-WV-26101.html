<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Parkersburg</h2>
<p>QPI Electrical Company Inc.

<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly. This is because the typical modern family uses more electrical appliances and devices than a family — let's say — 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
<p>When there is a blackout, a home backup generator will provide enough power. And because the switches are momentary contact, the switch returns to the center after flicking lights on or off.
