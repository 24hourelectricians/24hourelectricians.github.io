<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>These four solar-powered outdoor accent lights make ideal path lighting and can highlight hard-to-see obstacles for increased nighttime safety.

Again, the goal is to remove switched wires from the outlet and then provide power to the terminal where they were, using the unswitched wires to do so.</p>
<p>Attach the white to the unused terminal with the other white on the outlet and splice the ground to the ground going to the existing outlet, again with a short jumper so it can be re-attached back where it was. It is a problem that exists in over half of all American households - a wall switch in a room that turns on an outlet, but not the outlet that you want it to activate.
