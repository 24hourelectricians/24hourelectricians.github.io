Electricity is a tremendous force moving at the speed of light that we generate and control in wires and equipment. All of our trained electrical contractor professionals are committed to delivering the same standards of quality to residential customers throughout all of our service areas. If your panel is warm, has a burnt smell, or burn marks, these are all signs of a prehistoric panel that is not equipped to handle the amount of power that is flowing through it. This can cause a server issue of a house fire and other home issues.</p>

When John Michael Kohler founded his company in 1873, he had no way of knowing the positive impact his powerful products would have on people for generations to come.</p>
