The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>

<h3>Standby Generator Installation Services Shreveport LA 71106</h3>
<p>This technology allows us to backup larger services with smaller generators which helps reduce the cost to you. House size is just one criterion for selecting a standby generator.

When you're sure the breaker is off, remove the cover plate and unscrew the switch.

<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric. A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>
