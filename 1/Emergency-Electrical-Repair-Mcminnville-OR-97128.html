In many cases, putting in a spa or sauna requires a dedicated electrical circuit, and this should be handled by a licensed professional.

<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor. The most commos safety issue we see is when multiple circuits are installed under one fuse. During this time aluminum was a lot cheaper than copper and it conducted pretty similarly. You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>
<p>Common emergency repairs we see consist of GFI ground fault issues, breaker repairs after a lightning storm and outlet repairs due to circuit problems. When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current). Damaged service cables running from the structural mount on your building to the breaker panel should be handled by an electrician.</p>
