<p>Electrical Contractor - You must show proof of six years of experience and must hold a Rhode Island journeyperson license which has been valid for at least two years. Electrical repairs should always be done by a licensed and insured electrician. These range from small single outlet surge protectors to new age shapes and designs to fit in odd spaces. It's hard to find responsive contractors in this day and age that's why I highly recommend them to anyone who needs an electrical contractor.</p>
<p>Transformers using 12 volts can be easily installed by the homeowner, whereas in the case of a 120 volt system requires professional installation by a licensed electrical contractor and in some state you have to go the cost of a permit as well.
