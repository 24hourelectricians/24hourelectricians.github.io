Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together. For more than a century, Westinghouse has consistently provided innovative, reliable, high-quality products and customer service.</p>

MM Electric LLC will determine the best way that your electrical panel can be upgraded to increase the power available to your home or business.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
<p>If you need to buy or replace your point-of-use surge protectors, look for the UL label , or similar independent testing laboratory seal. It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
