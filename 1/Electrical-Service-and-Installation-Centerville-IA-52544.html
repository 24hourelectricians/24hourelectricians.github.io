Residential electricity as an industry is fairly young; electrical systems have only been a standard installation in new homes since about 1930. Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler.

It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Hiring an Electrical Contractor in Centerville IA</h3>
<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of.

Wiring a receptacle so that one half is a typical receptacle and the other half is controlled by a switch is commonly called a split-wired receptacle.</p>

This may be difficult because outlet wires may be crammed into the box. The live feed from the distribution board connects to the terminal marked â€˜common' in the double pole switch while the wire from the neutral terminal runs to the second double pole switch via a separate 3 wire cable.</p>
<p>When the utility power is restored, the transfer switch automatically transfers back to utility power, shutting down and instantly resetting itself for the next power interruption with no action required by the homeowner. Turn the power back on. As you progress in replacing bigger and more complicated fixtures you may want to try installing a new fixture where one did not exist.
