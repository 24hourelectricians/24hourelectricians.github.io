<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician Contractor in South Elgin</h2>
<p>The Residential Electrician C.T.S. Program is designed to prepare students for residential entry-level electrician positions. Electrical work is defined in the Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991 and means work on electrical machines or instruments, on an electrical installation or on electrical appliances or equipment to which electricity is supplied or intended to be supplied, at a nominal pressure exceeding 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct current, whether or not the thing on which the work is being performed is part of, or is connected to or to be connected to, any distribution works or private generating plant and, where work is performed on any appliance, whether or not electricity is supplied or may be supplied thereto through an electric plug socket or socket outlet.</p>
<p>Make sure all outdoor outlets are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) to help prevent electric shock. If an electric gadget gets wet, do not touch it or unplug it.

That means there are at least eight wires in the box: 4 hot (colored) wires, two whites, and two grounds.</p>
