<p>Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way.

Lay the lights out where you want to install them. Our residential electrical services ensure all home wiring is not only performed correctly and code … but that it will live up to current and future electrical requirements and continue to safely perform for years to come.</p>
