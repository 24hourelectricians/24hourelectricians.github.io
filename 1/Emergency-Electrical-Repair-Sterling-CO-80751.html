Some solar-powered lights even come with mounting screws and brackets that allow you to mount the light to the wall. If the circuit breaker keeps tripping, the breakers don't reset, your lights flicker when using large appliances or you see signs of a fire inside the panel box, then it's probably time for an upgrade.</p>
