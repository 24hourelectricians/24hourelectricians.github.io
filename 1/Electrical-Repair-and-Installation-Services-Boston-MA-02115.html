This new system is seen as an alternative to installing tracking lighting while still providing the flexibility of initially locating or, in some cases, repositioning the luminaires along the supply conductors to highlight paintings or other areas of interest. UNVLS transformers are manufactured to industry standards and offer the widest variety of transformers in the industry to include our new STL series that targets the fastest growing segment in landscape lighting with the innovation of LED Bulb Retrofit products.</p>

To achieve this wiring method, you will need a common device known as a T-connector The T-connector allows you to place your cable along the path of the lights, cut the cable at the last light, and then connect the middle of the laid-out cable to a new piece of cable that will run back to the power supply.</p>
<p>Electrical wiring problems can potentially cause serious fire and electrocution hazards, so it's better not to take a chance if there is any question in your mind about safety. Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in. If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
