<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Hickory Hills</h2>
<p>The Limited Residential Electrician apprenticeship program is a 2 year program designed to give students the experience and training necessary to become licensed limited residential electricians. Code § SPS 305.40 , the electrical wiring activities that may be undertaken by a person who holds a license or registration as a licensed Residential Master Electrician, a licensed Residential Journeyman Electrician or a registered Residential Electrical Apprentice shall be limited to wiring associated with dwellings, dwelling units and detached accessory buildings and structures serving the dwellings or the dwelling units, such as garages, carports, gazebos, and swimming pools.</p>
<p>Homeowners can stay safe by following municipal guidelines that require new swimming pools to be installed by licensed professionals, and by ensuring that any power sources near the pool be GFCI outlets to minimize the risk of electric shock.
