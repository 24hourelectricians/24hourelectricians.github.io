<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs. Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions. However, homes not located on a gas service network use propane to fuel their standby generators. Generally, purchasing a good surge protector gives you the benefit of having lower electricity costs and better quality of your appliances.</p>

Whatever style you choose, pick box sizes that have a volume of at least 20 cu. in. Dimmer switches and other smart devices are common these days and take up more room in the box than the simple devices of the past.
