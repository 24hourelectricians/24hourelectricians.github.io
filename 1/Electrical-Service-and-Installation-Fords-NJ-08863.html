<p>It is true that an extra wire in the switch box can be used as a neutral, but only if the other end can be located and tied to an existing, properly installed neutral. Otherwise, consider hiring a professional electrician. A licensed electrician will remove the electrical panel and inspect the wiring for problems before replacing the unit. Choose light sources that will be bright enough to satisfy the needs of the area, but that can be installed without producing glare or shining into someone else's yard.</p>
