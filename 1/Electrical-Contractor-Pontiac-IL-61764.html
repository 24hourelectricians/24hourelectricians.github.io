<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
