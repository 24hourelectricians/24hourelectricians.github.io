<h3>Different Types of Electrical Services in Orange CT</h3>
<p>Based on your description of painted wires and the age I also wonder whether you have some aluminum wiring. The 14-2 or 12-2 cable leaves breaker box and travels to the first junction box. However, these older apartments with obsolete electrical panels may not be able to support your modern electrical needs.

<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor. While most people are fine using the breaker panel that came with the home, other times problems arise and suggest an upgrade is in order.
