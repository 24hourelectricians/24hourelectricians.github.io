Whether you create a patio, barbecue island, or a full outdoor kitchen, you have a great place for entertaining, spending time with family, or just getting some fresh air in the safety of your own home.

Mid-sized - These are generators that will deliver between 11kw and 20 kW of power. Lighthouse can also upgrade your lighting to a new low-voltage LED system with the latest technology.</p>
<p>The most common fuel types for standby generators natural gas, propane, and diesel. For example, two side-by-side toggle light switches would require a two-gang switch plate. Consider that your office will probably require more electrical power because of an increase in cooling capacity due to computers and electronics that generate heat.

In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
<p>4. Circuit breaker box. And the risk of an electrical fire will also be less of a concern since you did the right thing in scheduling a service panel upgrade.
