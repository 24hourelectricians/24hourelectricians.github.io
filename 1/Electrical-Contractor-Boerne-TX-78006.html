Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity.

<p>By installing a circuit breaker sub panel, you make it clear which circuit breakers and branch circuits apply to which parts of the house. 99% of the time this is the reason they will not turn on.
