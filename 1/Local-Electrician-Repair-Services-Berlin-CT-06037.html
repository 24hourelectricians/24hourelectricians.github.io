<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh).

It is usually near the point where wires enter the house. Installing an electrical box indoors or outdoors costs the same, about $800 to $4,000, depending on the amperage.</p>
