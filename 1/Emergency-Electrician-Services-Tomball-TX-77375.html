<p>One of our neighbors has a beautiful home and uses several high powered fixtures to light up the house at night. We hope this post is helpful to our electrical engineering readers, and we look forward to continuing to help our readers and our IECD members to create extraordinary engineering careers.

<p>A small device to protect a computer, telephone, television set, or the like from damage by high-voltage electrical surges. So you'll connect the black hot wire coming from power to either black screw and then connect the black wire coming from the light fixture to the brass screw.
