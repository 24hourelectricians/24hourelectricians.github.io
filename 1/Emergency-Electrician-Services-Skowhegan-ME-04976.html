<p>For most projects, some combination of high and low voltage electrical systems are already being installed.

Another method that is not recommended is the loop, or lollipop,” which is basically a daisy chain with the wire run from the last fixture looped back to the first fixture or transformer tap. Before you shop for a new switch, remove your old one from the box—after making sure the power is off, of course—and look for a neutral white wire.</p>
