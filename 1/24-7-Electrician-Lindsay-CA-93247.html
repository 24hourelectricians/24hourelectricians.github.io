When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current). Damaged service cables running from the structural mount on your building to the breaker panel should be handled by an electrician.</p>
