A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V). When a threshold is over 120V, a surge protector shorts to ground voltage or blocks the voltage.</p>

Therefore in order to prevent accidents caused by electrical wirings you must know the proper precautions to do on it. It should be spliced to another black in the box (from your description), with a short piece added to the splice to go to the switch.

The dimensions, mechanical designs, and even the general appearance of light switches have changed slowly over time. When we offer our installation services, we generally provide you with multiple options, ensuring you get a system that works for your budget. We also offer maintenance plans for maintaining your generator, so it's in great working order whenever you need to use it. Once your generator has been installed, our tech will talk to you about which affordable maintenance plan is the right choice for you and your budget.</p>
