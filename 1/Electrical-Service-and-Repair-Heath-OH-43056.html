After any electrical wiring issues in your home have been repaired, take some time to learn about electricity and what to do in the case of an emergency.</p>

Fast Response to Service Calls - We have a large staff of electricians that can respond quickly to your emergency and non-emergency calls. Your home's electrical panel may have a severe problem if it's more than twenty years of age.</p>

Electricians may also charge you based on an hourly rate or per-project rate.
