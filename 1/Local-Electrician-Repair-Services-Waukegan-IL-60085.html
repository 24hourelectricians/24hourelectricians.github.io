<p>A larger-capacity breaker requires larger wiring in order to provide protection from electrical fires.

<p>Breaker can let too much electricity travel through the wire. Also, you must have 48 hours of classroom education with passing an exam. It typically located on the upper part of the panel and the smaller circuit breaker switched will be located underneath it.
