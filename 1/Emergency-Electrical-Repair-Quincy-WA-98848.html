<p>It is true that an extra wire in the switch box can be used as a neutral, but only if the other end can be located and tied to an existing, properly installed neutral. Otherwise, consider hiring a professional electrician. A licensed electrician will remove the electrical panel and inspect the wiring for problems before replacing the unit.

<h3>Electric Panels in Quincy WA - Buying Tips</h3>
<p>Size your wire accordingly, so you'll need to know what lights you'll be using from the initial rough in.
