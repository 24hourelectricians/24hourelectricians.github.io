They can be used for a purely functional reason, like providing security or lighting pathways and entryways, or used for as a decorative piece for an outdoor area.</p>
<p>The electrical panel is the heart of your electrical system. Instead, they hook up directly to your home's existing fuel line - whether it be natural gas or a form of liquid petroleum. To add a receptacle you need a proper hot, neutral and ground wire. When shopping for a standby generator, it is best to go through a certified generator dealer to ensure that a generator transfer switch is properly installed by a licensed electrician prior to generator installation.</p>

They come in different sizes, and it's important to make sure the right size wire is connected to the right size circuit breaker.</p>
