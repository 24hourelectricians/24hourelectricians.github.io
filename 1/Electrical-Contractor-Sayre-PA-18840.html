<p>Electrical wiring for a new log home is always a thing that worries owners. In most cases, this will provide you with enough coverage to keep your most important appliances running, such as your refrigerator, but it will not power not your entire home. If for any reason you think your electric service is underpowered and you are not tripping breakers or blowing fuses, you should call us for an immediate inspection. These generators are powered by natural gas or propane and start automatically during power outages. There are foot measurement indicators that let you know how much cable you have left, it is weather resistant from the sun and moisture as well as oil resistant, and it has a long term life expectancy for all of your low voltage cable lighting.</p>

Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>

The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>

Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
