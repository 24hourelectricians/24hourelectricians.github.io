<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade. If you're trying to remodel and your electrical panel is out of date, it could cause some serious problems when remodeling. Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>
<p>Before you install a low-voltage system, map out a lighting scheme to determine the amount of wire and number of fixtures you need. Rejuvenation includes new manufacturer required breakers, new connections inside your equipment, and full panel labeling so you know what each breaker does.

Step and pathway lights are popular for lining walkways, and in-ground well lights add a remarkable upward glow to water or architectural features.</p>
<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
