<h3>How Do Emergency Home Backup Generators Work Salem IL 62881</h3>
<p>In most cases the wires have to be buried at least 18 inches deep and therefore must be placed in protective conduit, or go the expensive route and use wiring that can go directly underground without any protective encasing. Generators can be powered by different resources: Gasoline powered generators are perhaps the most commonly used type of generator. Mid-sized - These are generators that will deliver between 11kw and 20 kW of power. Lighthouse can also upgrade your lighting to a new low-voltage LED system with the latest technology.</p>
<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
<p>While lightning is one of the most common causes for a power surge to spike and fry your electrical devices, something as simple as turning on your vacuum could cause a power surge within your home. Our full-time, in-house journeyman electricians are fully equipped with aerial lifts, ladder vans, and bucket trucks. Outdoor light fixtures provide ambiance.

By updating the panel and getting experienced advice on the state of your wiring, you can rest assured that your home's electrical system is safe. Since the generator is connected to your house's electrical panel, you don't need to go out and turn the switch on, connect extension cords, and connect it your home appliances.</p>
