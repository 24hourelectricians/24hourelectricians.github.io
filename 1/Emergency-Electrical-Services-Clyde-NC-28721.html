Upgrade the electrical wiring in your home to the latest acceptable standards if you have an older home or if your electrical needs outstrip your current demands. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component.

Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
