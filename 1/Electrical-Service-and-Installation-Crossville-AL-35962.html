<p>Whether you are in the process of building your own home and being your own contractor, remodeling part of your house or finishing a basement, its important that you find the most reputable, recommended electrician in your area to do the work. Pros: Home standby generators are largely worry-free. When you hire a qualified electrician for an electrical inspection, they will test the circuits that run to the outlets and switches for signs of damage.

<p>If your devices are more than 10 meters away from the installed SPD, additional protection needs to be added, such as a type 3 SPD in a nearby switchboard of a power strip with integrated surge protection. This is however dependent on the size of the property and what fixtures you choose for the same. One of the most well recognized brand name among generators is Generac.
