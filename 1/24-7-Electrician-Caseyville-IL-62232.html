<p>The NEC is a standard used in electrical wiring to help set safety expectations in both a national and local setting as published by the National Fire Protection Association. Our licensed and insured professionals can safely handle all of your electrical needs. Your standby generator will run on natural gas or liquid propane, so you never need to stock up on gasoline to keep it running. Contact us online Â or call us at 770.594.9969 to schedule the installation.Â We'll call you to confirm your time and send you a confirmation email with a picture of your electrician, so you know who's coming to your house.</p>
<p>Today's homes require up to 200 amps of power or more. You might decide to go with a reputable company that has a history with standby generator system installation If you have no company in mind, then go with a referral. There are three colors of wires in a typical single-pole toggle switch: black, white, and green. Before doing any work on the switch, the power source must be turned off by set­ting a circuit breaker to OFF or removing a fuse. Provide branch circuit overcurrent protection for each contactor or starter in accordance with the National Electric Code® and local electrical codes.</p>
<p>It is uncommon to only update an electrical panel and not the entire service; however, this cost can range from $1,500 - $2,000 depending on the conditions. In this case you already have a constant hot in the outlet box, to run the outlet, and won't need any additional wire. If you've had trouble with electricity or appliances working properly, this post will shed some light on if you need to upgrade your electrical panel, how to determine your panel's capacity and why hiring an electrician is the best way to go if you are thinking about how you can change your electrical panel yourself.</p>

Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
