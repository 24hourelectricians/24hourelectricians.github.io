<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler.

Extension cords should only be used on a temporary basis and unplugged and safely stored after every use.</p>

Check that extension cords are correctly rated for the amount of electricity they are to carry and are Underwriter Laboratory (UL) approved. It is also responsible for switching the lights off when the room is empty and turn these on upon sensing the presence of an occupant.
