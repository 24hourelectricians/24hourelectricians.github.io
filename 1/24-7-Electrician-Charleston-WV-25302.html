In many ways, a relatively active job like electrical work is preferable to a job that has you parked in front of a computer all day - the dangers of sitting down for long periods of time are well-documented , and this isn't something you'll have to worry about too often when you're working as an electrician, zipping from one job to the next all day long.</p>
