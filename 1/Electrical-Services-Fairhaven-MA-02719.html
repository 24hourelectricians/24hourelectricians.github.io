The first rubber-insulated cables for US building wiring were introduced in 1922 with US patent 1458803 , Burley, Harry & Rooney, Henry, "Insulated electric wire", issued 1923-06-12, assigned to Boston Insulated Wire And Cable citation needed These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation, plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation, with an overall woven jacket, usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture.</p>
<p>Federal Pacific circuit breaker panels, with their faulty Stab-Lok breakers, still lurk in many older homes, says Volpe who replaces at least 300 each year.
