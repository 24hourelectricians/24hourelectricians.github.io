Well lights are light fixtures (that can be low voltage) which can be buried in the ground and lie concealed and up light any surrounding landscape, architecture, and lights create the illusory effect of light spewing from the earth itself. Water conducts electricity, so the fire could actually ignite further. We know that people do business with companies that meet their needs and provide reliable service.</p>
