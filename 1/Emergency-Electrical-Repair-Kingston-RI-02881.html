We hope this post is helpful to our electrical engineering readers, and we look forward to continuing to help our readers and our IECD members to create extraordinary engineering careers. Closed doors create damaged cords. Power surges (also known as transient voltage events), are increases in voltage that are well above the normal flow of electric power.</p>
