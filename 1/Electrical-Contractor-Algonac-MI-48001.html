The cost of a sub-panel is usually less than a full-sized breaker panel due to its smaller size, lower amperage rating, and fewer circuit breakers. Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis. In order to do this, you must have good wiring design (load-wise) and ensure power sources are situated around the property to allow all wire runs to be within 200' of the transformer.</p>
