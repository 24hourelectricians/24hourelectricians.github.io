Otherwise, consider hiring a professional electrician. A licensed electrician will remove the electrical panel and inspect the wiring for problems before replacing the unit. Choose light sources that will be bright enough to satisfy the needs of the area, but that can be installed without producing glare or shining into someone else's yard.</p>
