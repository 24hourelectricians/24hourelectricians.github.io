Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage.

Our electricians will treat your property as if it were their own, exercising caution and using the professional skill we are known for when completing a job. However, to contract, or offer to contract, to carry out electrical installation work, a licensed electrician must also be registered as an electrical contractor.</p>

<p>If your devices are more than 10 meters away from the installed SPD, additional protection needs to be added, such as a type 3 SPD in a nearby switchboard of a power strip with integrated surge protection. This is however dependent on the size of the property and what fixtures you choose for the same. One of the most well recognized brand name among generators is Generac.
