A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).

Let's dive into what low voltage lighting is, how it's different from line voltage lighting, and the pros and cons of using this kind of system in your space.

<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs. Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions.
