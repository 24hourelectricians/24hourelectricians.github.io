Our NATE-certified technicians are trained to install portable and whole-home generators for any home in the area. Electrical Contractor License: According to the Board, municipalities can accept contracting business owners, their partners, chairman of the board or CEO that present the contracting business. Once you check that everything is working, bury the extra wire, secure the lights, and do any final adjustments to make sure everything looks good.</p>
<p>If one or more of the phases is missing, disconnect the primary voltage source (incoming power disconnect switch) and replace the incoming power fuses or reset the motor-control circuit breaker. That way the second outlet can be switched while leaving the GFI on at all times.
