<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
