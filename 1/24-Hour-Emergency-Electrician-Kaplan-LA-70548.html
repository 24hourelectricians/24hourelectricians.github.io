From achieving ambient lighting in your living room or kitchen through expert ceiling light fitting or replacing of faulty fixtures with new modern lighting solutions to maximising your wall accent lighting options, the professional electricians can help you out. If the same results still occur (namely, the light only stays ON if the wires are held together - similar to holding down a button), then the relay is the problem and will need replacing.</p>

This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time.

<p>It is dangerous to work on an open electrical service panel with both the door and the protective front cover removed. The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows.
