Most extension cords aren't built to handle high-powered items such as air conditioners, refrigerators, or space heaters. For internal surface installation switches shall be provided with matching steel box and shall be with metal clad finish. From there, circuits carry all the needed electricity to the appliances, lights, and outlets in your home.
