A licensed Electrical Contractor shall utilize the appropriately licensed or registered individuals to construct, install, repair or maintain electrical wiring.

Where a stationary generator would be required are situations where power must be restored immediately should an outage occur.</p>
<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
