<h3>Residential Electrician Serving Reidsville NC 27320</h3>
<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>They also do not trip as circuit breakers do so when they become overloaded, they are more likely to cause a fire. Be sure to check our Parking Lot Lighting Service section for other information regarding Parking Lot Lighting. Be smart, plan ahead and schedule one of our tune-ups to ensure that your generator is always ready to keep you safe and comfortable anytime power goes off.

One of the main factors to consider when deciding between hiring a lighting professional or doing it yourself is the scope of the design. If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>
<p>Copper ground wire. Use safety covers on all outlets accessible to children. Add lights, and the price goes up.

Better protectors exceed ratings of 1,000 joules and 40,000 amperes.
