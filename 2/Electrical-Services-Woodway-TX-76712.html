If the incoming ground wire from the feed circuit was left long enough, it can be run continuously, connected to a grounding screw that connects the wire to the metal junction box (skip this step if plastic junction boxes are in use), on to the ground screw terminal at each electrical receptacle, and ending with a ground clamp crimp connector that ties the incoming ground to the ground wire of the outgoing wire that continues to the next junction box.</p>
<p>Requirements vary, but usually call for the completion of an approved training program, work as a journey worker and passing a test on electrical codes.

Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
