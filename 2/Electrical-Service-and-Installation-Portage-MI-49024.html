I think that is one of the reasons why Generac came out with the 22KW unit, even though it uses the same two cylinder engine in order to pump up the NG output. Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late.
