<p>Keep cords away from sources of heat and water. You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet. When you replace fuse box with breaker panel, your home becomes safer. Do not overload outlets with multiple adaptors or power strips; relocate cords instead.

<p>Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry.

You should consider the architecture of your house when choosing the style of the light fixture. Sharp prongs inside the connectors pierce the cable and make contact with the wires.</p>

If there is no neutral wire in the switch box, such as in the diagram at the top of this page, you likely cannot use a smart switch. It's recommended to replace it after a major electrical event (such as when lightning blows out the transformer down your street).
