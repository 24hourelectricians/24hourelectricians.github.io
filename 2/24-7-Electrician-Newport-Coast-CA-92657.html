<p>An electrical panel (or breaker box) is the source of your home's electrical system. And power outages can threaten the very lives of those who depend on electrically powered medical equipment to stay alive and well. For example, if a circuit breaker repeatedly trips after being reset, electricians determine the reason and fix it. If there is voltage, and the switch is operating properly check the water pump wiring for an inline fuse. Important Note: We can only perform service and maintenance on generators that we install. Pull the outlet and wires out from the wall enough that you have space to work.</p>
