<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Glasgow</h2>
<p>Importance of hiring a certified and licensed electrician. Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>
<p>Open and tag the power supply circuit for the outlet being replaced. Any outlet near water should be switched to code-correct GFCI outlets.

The breaker panel controls and ensures the safe delivery of the electricity in your home. Unscrew and remove old electrical panel from the wall.</p>
<p>Electricians need to be strong enough to move heavy components, which may weigh up to 50 pounds. Be wary of items purchased outside or imported into the UK, as these don't always meet national safety standards, and definitely avoid counterfeit electrical goods (such as off-brand hair straighteners), which are the leading cause of electrical shocks and fires. Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
