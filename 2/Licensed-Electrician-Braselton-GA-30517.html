<p>The Commercial-Residential Electrician program offers an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience in residential and commercial electrical service installation as well as a solid theoretical foundation. The first rubber-insulated cables for US building wiring were introduced in 1922 with US patent 1458803 , Burley, Harry & Rooney, Henry, "Insulated electric wire", issued 1923-06-12, assigned to Boston Insulated Wire And Cable citation needed These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation, plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation, with an overall woven jacket, usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture.</p>
<p>Consequently, electricians with less than a year of experience make up just 2 percent of the workforce. Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle. Always be sure to hire a professional for wiring and panel upgrades; this type of work requires the skills of a licensed electrician for the optimum safety. Master Electrician License: A journeyman electrician's license is required.</p>
<p>If your home still relies on an old-fashioned panel with fuses, which is common in homes built prior to 1960, then you probably want to upgrade to an electrical panel with circuit breakers.

Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>
