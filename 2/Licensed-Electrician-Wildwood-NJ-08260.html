<p>This evaluation should include a thorough examination of the existing electrical service, electrical panel and wiring system. Your Breaker is Old - If your breaker box is old and the parts required for breaker repair are no longer available, it may be time to consider an upgrade. So, if a power surge occurs, the device will keep any harmful electrical currents from damaging your home devices.
