Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

If you have never dealt with electrical installations, you should definitely consult with a professional.

Journeyman Electrician: You need 4 years of experience, along with 240 hours of training. Electric cords are how we get a power supply to our appliance. Consumers should check for problems with their home electrical systems, and be ever vigilant for electrical hazards around the home and the workplace, like cracked or fraying cords, overheating cords and wall plates, and the presence of overhead and buried power lines when working outdoors.</p>

Whereas a portable generator can only run a few of your electrical devices, a standby generator has enough juice to power your entire home - this includes your lights, appliances, and even entertainment devices.</p>

If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
