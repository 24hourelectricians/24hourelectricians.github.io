All electricity that passes through your home must first travel through the breakers to ensure the safe passage of electricity through the system. Destination Lighting also has a growing selection of low voltage landscape lights that are easier to install and safe to operate in wet conditions. Deck and step lights are designed to help make navigating decks, patios and outdoor stairways much safer at night.</p>

On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years.
