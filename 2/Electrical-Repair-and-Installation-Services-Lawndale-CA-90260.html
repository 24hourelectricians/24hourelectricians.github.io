Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>
<p>A damaged or broken connection in the receptacle itself, or if the bottom receptacle opening was split-wired to be powered by a different circuit, that circuit may have an open wire or a tripped breaker or fuse - OR - it may have been wired to a light switch in the room. Fast Response to Service Calls - We have a large staff of electricians that can respond quickly to your emergency and non-emergency calls.

<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket.
