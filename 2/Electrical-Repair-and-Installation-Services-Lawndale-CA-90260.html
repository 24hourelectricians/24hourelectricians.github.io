<p>Lights, cell phones, computers, televisions, sound systems, and even many appliances and HVAC systems run on electricity. I have installed 1,000's of outdoor lighting systems for almost 30 years now, primarily 12 volt Garden lighting. Once the energy audit is complete, the electrician lays out a list of recommendations. Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>
<p>A damaged or broken connection in the receptacle itself, or if the bottom receptacle opening was split-wired to be powered by a different circuit, that circuit may have an open wire or a tripped breaker or fuse - OR - it may have been wired to a light switch in the room. Fast Response to Service Calls - We have a large staff of electricians that can respond quickly to your emergency and non-emergency calls. Your home's electrical panel may have a severe problem if it's more than twenty years of age.</p>

<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket.
