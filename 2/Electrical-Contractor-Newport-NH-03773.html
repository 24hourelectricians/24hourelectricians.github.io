<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade. Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home. If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>
<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
