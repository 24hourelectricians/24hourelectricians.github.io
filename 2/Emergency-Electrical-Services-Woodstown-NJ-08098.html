<p>The Residential Electrician C.T.S. Program is designed to prepare students for residential entry-level electrician positions. Electrical work is defined in the Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991 and means work on electrical machines or instruments, on an electrical installation or on electrical appliances or equipment to which electricity is supplied or intended to be supplied, at a nominal pressure exceeding 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct current, whether or not the thing on which the work is being performed is part of, or is connected to or to be connected to, any distribution works or private generating plant and, where work is performed on any appliance, whether or not electricity is supplied or may be supplied thereto through an electric plug socket or socket outlet.</p>

Having to throw away all of your food and replace it all is not only costly (not to mention an annoying and time consuming task), but if you're in a situation where you're trapped in your home for a few days because of the weather, you're going to depend on the food you have until you can safely leave your house. When aluminum wires are only twisted together, like you would with copper, the wires expand and contract then current flows through them which produces heat from the poor connection and if the wires has oxidized, this will heat up the connection even further, causing a potential for overheating and a possible fire.</p>
