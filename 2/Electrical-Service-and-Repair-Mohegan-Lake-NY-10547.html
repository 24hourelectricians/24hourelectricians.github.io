<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home. People who splice wires by twisting the ends together and covering the result with electrical tape face a higher risk of encountering a problem in the future.</p>
<p>Anytime you work with electricity, it can be very dangerous and only a qualified electrician should install this equipment. In Montgomery County, Maryland, electrical contractors need a master electrician's license before they can obtain a permit to do any work in the county. Now, that's not to suggest that there is ever a good time for electrical emergencies, but rather to call attention to the fact that there are two types of electricians in the area: those that are only available for eight hours a day and those who make sure they are on-call to assist homes in the area whenever they need it.</p>

Homeowners should be especially vigilant in the following situations with their outlets The safe and smart response is to move quickly and resolve your electrical switch and outlet issues.</p>
