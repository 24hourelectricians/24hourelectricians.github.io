<p>No matter whether you're looking to install a single light fixture or you need a contractor capable enough to perform a complete home lighting retrofit in Charlotte, the lighting contractors at Acosta have you covered. Light switch and light fixture locations where un-switched 120-volt power is available. One of them is pathway lighting; this can be the lowest voltage of all and primarily designed to give a downward or even an outward glow. In short, the electrical panel dictates the maximum capacity” of power within your home.</p>
<p>You can also call 1-800-624-4488 and speak with one of our knowledgeable staff members for more advice on landscape lighting. Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>The cost of labor is usually set by the local National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), although non-member electricians are not bound by their hourly wage. A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing. The landscape lighting that requires the greatest effort to install is 120-volt lighting.</p>
