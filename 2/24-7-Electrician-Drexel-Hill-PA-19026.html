<p>You might be considering repainting interior rooms or completing some other small remodeling projects over the winter months. Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC.

After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device.

All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
