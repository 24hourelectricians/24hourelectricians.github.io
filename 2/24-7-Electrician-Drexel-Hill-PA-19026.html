<p>You might be considering repainting interior rooms or completing some other small remodeling projects over the winter months. Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC.

<p>Charging stations for electric vehicles can increase power consumption as much as 50 amps at 220 volts. After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device.

All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
