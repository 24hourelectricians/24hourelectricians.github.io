We offer various options, including different fuel sources like propane or natural gas, different cooling methods such as liquid-cooling or air-cooling, and a whole range of different sizes and power outputs. That means there are at least eight wires in the box: 4 hot (colored) wires, two whites, and two grounds.</p>
