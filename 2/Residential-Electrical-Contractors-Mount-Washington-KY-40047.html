<p>For safety reasons, do not put the lights closer than 10 feet from a pool, spa or pond. The path on how to become electrician usually starts either with an apprenticeship or a term as an electrician's helper. At NY Landscape Lighting, we want to improve your life through the design, installation, and service of outdoor LED lighting. Home generators are a backup power source for your home that will automatically turn on in seconds following any power outage or power service interruption, keeping the lights on, the water hot, the HVACⓇ or heat on, your electronics charged and operational, keeping your lines of communication open, and your home safe and secure for your family and your property.</p>

Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>

We offer a full range of electrical services to keep your home running in top shape.
