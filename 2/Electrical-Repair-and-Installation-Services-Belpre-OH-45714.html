Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency.

<p>If you are overloading your outlets, you may need to install a new circuit. You can also wire it up so that the switch controls the outlet and the light it's connected to, which may be useful if you have a lamp plugged into the outlet. This course covers the operation and maintenance of high-voltage circuit breakers and switchgear (4 KV and above) that are typically used for in-plant distribution of electrical power. If you don't have adequate knowledge of the numerous wirings of the electrical panel, make sure you contact Mr. Electric for the circuit breaker repair.</p>

<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the operation and maintenance of large alternating current (AC) generators, which are primarily used to supply electrical power in the magnitude of kilowatts (thousands of watts) and megawatts (millions of watts). Master electricians are certified to act as an administrator to make sure an electrical contractor's work follows the electrical laws and rules. Although aluminum is more cost-effective, electricians warn homeowners that this type of wiring must be installed properly, otherwise it can increase the risk of house fires.</p>
