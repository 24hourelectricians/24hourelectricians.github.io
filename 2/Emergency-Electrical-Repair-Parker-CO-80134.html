<p>However, this doesn't mean that being an electrician is always easy going. Where wiring, or raceways that hold the wiring, must traverse fire-resistance rated walls and floors, the openings are required by local building codes to be firestopped In cases where safety-critical wiring must be kept operational during an accidental fire, fireproofing must be applied to maintain circuit integrity in a manner to comply with a product's certification listing The nature and thickness of any passive fire protection materials used in conjunction with wiring and raceways has a quantifiable impact upon the ampacity derating, because the thermal insulation properties needed for fire resistance also inhibit air cooling of power conductors.</p>
<p>When wiring standard switches, the wires connected to the switch are both hot. The electrical panel in your home can go for years without the need for any upgrades or replacements.

<p>In most cases, solar is a specialty classification under the general electrical or plumbing licenses and all appropriately licensed contractors can install solar systems without the solar specialty license. The operation of DC motors is based on the same principles as is the operation of AC motors. In this article series we list common old building electrical wiring system safety concerns and we illustrate types of old electrical wires and devices. This diagram shows the wiring for multiple switched outlets on one switch.</p>
