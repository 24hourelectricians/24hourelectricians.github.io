Whether you need help installing a light switch, wiring an outlet or running a wire to a new lighting fixture, the Handy platform will connect you with the right electrical service professional with the right experience.</p>

<p>You could even add half hot outlets by using a 3 rope wire with black, red, white and green if you would like to. Two of my living room outlets, for instance, are operated from the same switch. I have another neighbor who leaves several safety lights on all night long. These tasks, though important, are only one of the many electricians might tackle. This includes all residential and commercial services, from bonding and grounding to generator installation and repair.</p>
<p>Electricians can also install and upgrade outlets for safety purposes.
