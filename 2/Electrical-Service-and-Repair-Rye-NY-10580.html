<p>We have a policy never to rush into signing contracts or to fix of lighting materials as handymen do. We go through the details of each job demand bit by bit for us and a given client to form a synergy - we first understand what the client wants, how they want it and why they opted for a given service. Well, it means that over time, a surge protector is going to wear out. If the outlet is switching on and off properly, and the lights are wired to the neutral and switched hot wire as described they should work.</p>

We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office.
