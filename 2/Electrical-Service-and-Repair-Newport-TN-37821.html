Safety: Another essential advantage of having an outdoor lighting system is safety.</p>
<p>We bought the Generac 20kW and even though we have not needed it, it is a big insurance policy for us if something would happen that we would lose our electricity.

If you were planning to power everything listed above then, at first glance, you might think that you're going to need a 30,000 watt generator.
