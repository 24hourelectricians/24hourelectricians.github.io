<p>It is true that an extra wire in the switch box can be used as a neutral, but only if the other end can be located and tied to an existing, properly installed neutral.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>
