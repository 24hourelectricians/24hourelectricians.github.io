<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
