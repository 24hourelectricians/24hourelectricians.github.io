<h2>Green Energy Solutious Dallas North Carolina</h2>
<p>The main benefit of a standby whole house generator installation is that they will power your house for days after a power outage. If you live in an area with frequent (more than three times a year) or lengthy (more than several hours) blackouts, then a standby generator becomes more of a necessity than a simple convenience.

Take Your Surge Protector for a Spin by Grgegory Schmidt, The New York Times, January 30, 2013.
