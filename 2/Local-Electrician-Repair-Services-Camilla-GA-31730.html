<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade. Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home. If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>

However, a good general rule is that the final installed cost is usually twice the price of the generator.
