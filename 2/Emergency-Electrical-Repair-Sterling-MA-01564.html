<h3>Do You Need A Surge Protector For Your Entire Home Sterling MA 01564</h3>
<p>In most cases the wires have to be buried at least 18 inches deep and therefore must be placed in protective conduit, or go the expensive route and use wiring that can go directly underground without any protective encasing.
