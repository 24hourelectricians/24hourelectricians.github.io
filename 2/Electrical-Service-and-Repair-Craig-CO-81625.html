Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>
<p>Make sure all outdoor outlets are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) to help prevent electric shock. If an electric gadget gets wet, do not touch it or unplug it.
