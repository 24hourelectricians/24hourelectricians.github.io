AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>
<p>Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician.

<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ). The tabs held the box flush with the drywall and kept it from falling in while I screwed them into the studs.

<h3>Industrial Electrical Services in Carpinteria CA</h3>
<p>Since all your electrical power goes through the breaker panel, it's vital to ensure that the panel is working safely and efficiently. When the service panel starts to wear down, it becomes increasingly susceptible to power surges.
