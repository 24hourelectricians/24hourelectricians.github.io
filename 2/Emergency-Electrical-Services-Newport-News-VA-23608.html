These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised.
