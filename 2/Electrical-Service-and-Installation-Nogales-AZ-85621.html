<p>Surge protectors will indeed protect computers and other electronic devices from power surges and most distant lightning strikes, but they can't prevent a direct lighting strike from causing damage to connected devices. Low voltage landscape lighting wire or landscape lighting cable as it is often referred as, is made of multi-strands of copper wire that are bound together. According to the EFSi, arcing faults cause more than 30,000 home fires each year in the US alone, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries - atop more than $750 million in property damage.</p>
<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable. In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>In that case the electrician may run a 14-2 wire (hot, neutral, ground) from the receptacle box to the switch, putting black tape on the ends of the white wire to show that BOTH wires are actually carrying current. This board licenses and regulates electrical contractors; registers qualified journeyman electricians; and is responsible for granting exemptions from licensure to persons or businesses engaged in telecommunications wiring in New Jersey.
