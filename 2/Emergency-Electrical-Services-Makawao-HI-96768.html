<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Contractor in Makawao</h2>
<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>A lot of us keep a generator around for those occasions where some extra power might be warranted, but a home standby generator isn't just a little piece for handling a couple of extra rooms. Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything. Fuses can only be used once; when a current is running at a level that's too high, the fuse will interrupt the electrical flow by melting.</p>
