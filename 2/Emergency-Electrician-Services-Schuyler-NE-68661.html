And all modern Wi-Fi enabled, digital dimmers and USB charging outlets are tight fits in older single gang boxes. The emphasis is on practical issues that go beyond typical electrical principles, providing a tool-kit of skills in solving electrical problems, ranging from control circuits to motors and variable speed drives.</p>
<p>2. Position your ground level lights in such a way that they almost peep out of the plants that surround them.
