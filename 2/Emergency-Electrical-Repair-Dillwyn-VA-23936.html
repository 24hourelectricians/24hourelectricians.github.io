<h3>Outdoor, Patio & Landscape Lighting Dillwyn VA 23936</h3>
<p>Many fires are started by extension cords because they are used improperly, tied in knots, overloaded, stowed under rugs and carpet, used for circuit wiring, frayed or cracked or otherwise compromised. Landscape lights are also available in different voltages - 12 volt and 120 volt. Education: Residential electricians must obtain a high school diploma, engage in an apprenticeship program, attend classes, 8,000-10,000 hours of on the job experience and the pass a competency exam to then become licensed to perform their work.</p>

Extension cords - Never substitute for permanent wiring. If the yard is full of trees or does not receive sufficient sun light due to surrounding buildings, the solar landscape light will not function for the specified duration.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for. It is best to let our team of professional electricians install your LED recessed lights because we are aware of local building codes that may pertain to the installation work.</p>
