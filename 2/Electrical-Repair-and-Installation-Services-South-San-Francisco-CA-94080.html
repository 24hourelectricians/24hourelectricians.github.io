<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of. When planning your outdoor lighting wire route, place the lights where you would like them, then lay out the wires, try to keep the wires near walkways, driveways, and patios or places where a stray shovel won't encounter the wire.
