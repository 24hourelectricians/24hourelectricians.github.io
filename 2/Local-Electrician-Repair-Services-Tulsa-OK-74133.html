<p>A whole house product is more expensive than simple single-outlet surge protectors and often needs professional installation on the incoming electrical power feed; however, they prevent power line spikes from entering the house. Be on the lookout for power lines when using a chainsaw or other outdoor equipment. All surge protectors have a specified response time, this means the period of time in which the surge protector does not stabilise the voltage levels, obviously, the higher the response time then the greater the risk to the appliance in question.</p>
