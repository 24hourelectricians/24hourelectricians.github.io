<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Sussex</h2>
<p>Are the circuit breakers in your home constantly tripping? Electrical switches, timers, outlets, lights etc are never wired in series. Electricity is a tremendous force moving at the speed of light that we generate and control in wires and equipment. All of our trained electrical contractor professionals are committed to delivering the same standards of quality to residential customers throughout all of our service areas.

<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors. Utility - Lighting that fulfills this requirement is usually going to be used to light a walkway or driveway, or some other outdoor structure such as a carport or shed.</p>
