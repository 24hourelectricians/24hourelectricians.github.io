<h2>Backup Generator Service Topsham Maine</h2>
<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>

If you answer yes to any of the following questions, you should upgrade or replace your old panel and install a new functional electrical system.</p>
<p>When you are comparing surge protectors, do not just focus on the best price. Maintenance then can perform the repair and rebalancing in place during regularly scheduled downtime, avoiding possible service interruption and major damage.

<p>Your home has a 60-amp electrical service. Our electricians will always make sure your project is handled in a professional, safe, and expert manner.

<p>The cost of labor is usually set by the local National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), although non-member electricians are not bound by their hourly wage. A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing. The landscape lighting that requires the greatest effort to install is 120-volt lighting.</p>
