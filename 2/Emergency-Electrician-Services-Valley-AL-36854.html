Given that, I'd check the wiring at both switch and outlet. One of the first things to consider when installing a generator in your home is what type of fuel source you want it to run on. When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>
<p>Each electrical contractor must employ at least one master electrician. Now pull out the white wires that are inside of the switch box, but do not take them apart.
