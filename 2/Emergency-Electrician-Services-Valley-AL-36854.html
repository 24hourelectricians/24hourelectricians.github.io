Given that, I'd check the wiring at both switch and outlet. One of the first things to consider when installing a generator in your home is what type of fuel source you want it to run on. When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>
<p>Each electrical contractor must employ at least one master electrician. Now pull out the white wires that are inside of the switch box, but do not take them apart. Connect the power cable to the transformer, and mount the transformer.
