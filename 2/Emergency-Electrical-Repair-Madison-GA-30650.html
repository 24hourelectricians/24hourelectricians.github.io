<h3>Most Dangerous Home Electrical Hazards Madison GA 30650</h3>
<p>There is one aspect of electrical panel replacement that few people ever consider, and that's the immense savings you can receive. Old electric panels contain fuses, which can have problems. Because modern homes us a number of energy-hungry appliances, a 200-amp panel is the minimum we'd suggest. We use that information to determine if you need a panel change or an entire service upgrade.

<p>The breaker panel is the heart of your home's electric. Wiring for short extensions to outlets in hung ceiling or to equipment, motors etc. Upgrading electrical service means replacing the current panel box with a new larger one. We provide quality installed backup generators, maintenance and repair services to keep both your home and business protected.

<p>The price to replace an old fuse box with a modern electrical panel will be far greater than installing a small secondary electrical panel for a generator. Upgrade your home panel board with our safety devices for better protection of people and electronic equipment. You'll still want to take account of everything you think you'll need to power, for many people it's simply going to be unfeasible to power the whole home like normal with a standby generator.</p>
