In the safe use of electricity in the home, circuit breakers should be used to terminate power to outlets.</p>
<p>By buying a larger capacity transformer for your low voltage wiring, you ensure that you can add more lights later if you want. This means your appliances could malfunction if they aren't receiving enough electricity or overload if they are receiving too much.
