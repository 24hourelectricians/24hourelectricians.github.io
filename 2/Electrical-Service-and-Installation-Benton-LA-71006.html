This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring.

Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below. Needless to say, a home standby generator will give you power when you need it most.</p>
<p>The electrical panel is the heart of your electrical system. Instead, they hook up directly to your home's existing fuel line - whether it be natural gas or a form of liquid petroleum. To add a receptacle you need a proper hot, neutral and ground wire. When shopping for a standby generator, it is best to go through a certified generator dealer to ensure that a generator transfer switch is properly installed by a licensed electrician prior to generator installation.</p>
