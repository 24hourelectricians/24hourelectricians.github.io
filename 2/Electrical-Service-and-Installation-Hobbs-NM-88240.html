Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>

On Time Electrical is here to stress the importance of doing so. We are an electrical company that offers electrical panel replacement and installation services in Charlotte.
