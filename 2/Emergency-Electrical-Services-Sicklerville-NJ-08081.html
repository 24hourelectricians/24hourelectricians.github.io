You can easily keep your electronics and home safe with the use of surge protectors that you can find at the web site. Turn off the power to the switch at the main circuit breaker or fuse panel.

<p>Apprentice License: The DOL license is required and licenses electrical sign apprentices separately. Run a cable from the circuit breaker panel to your new outlet location.
