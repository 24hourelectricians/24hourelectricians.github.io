I have the wiring figured out, and I've custom-clipped a universal power cord from a couple old computers… What I NEED… is to know what box to use… and if it's kosher to melt two differing styles of thermoplastic face plates together in order to put Decora and other Industrial style sockets together in the same box… Decora has a 4 USB outlet I want to use next to an industrial Red and Red-with-Light Switch isolated from the rest of the circuit powering the USB ports and other sockets, giving me a kill switch for the Red sockets for emergency use.</p>
