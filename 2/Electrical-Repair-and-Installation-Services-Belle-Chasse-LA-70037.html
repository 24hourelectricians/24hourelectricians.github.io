After completing this course, participants should be able to describe the basic construction and operation of direct current (DC) motors, alternating current (AC) induction motors, and AC synchronous motors. Lenses and grates can be easily installed on these fixtures for many custom lighting applications.</p>
<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
