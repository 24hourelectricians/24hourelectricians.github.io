Improperly wired panels and short circuits could spark a fire, causing your home to sustain fire and smoke damage. A home standby generator is a little bit more of a complex undertaking than just running a portable and using an extension cord and some surge protectors.</p>
<p>However there are devices called whole house surge protectors that provide more of a blanket of protection for all of a home's electronic devices. Our electricians will treat your property as if it were their own, exercising caution and using the professional skill we are known for when completing a job.
