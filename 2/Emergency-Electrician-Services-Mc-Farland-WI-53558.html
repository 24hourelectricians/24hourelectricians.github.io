Whether you work in a busy office or are a stay-at-home parent, there's nothing worse than waiting for hours for an electrical service provider to turn up.

Alternatively, you can wire the switch up in such a way that only that single outlet will be controlled by the switch, but other outlets in the circuit will still stay powered on constantly.</p>
