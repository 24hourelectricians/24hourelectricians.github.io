We have developed easy rules‚Äù to follow to ensure that your low voltage system is installed with even voltage to all your fixtures.

Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
