<p>Our licensed, professional electricians service commercial properties all across Central Texas, whether it's changing light bulbs or addressing a location's entire electrical service. Generally speaking, though, being an electrician doesn't come with any major risks to your long-term physical health (excluding the potential for electrical shocks, which you can read about here ). In many ways, a relatively active job like electrical work is preferable to a job that has you parked in front of a computer all day - the dangers of sitting down for long periods of time are well-documented , and this isn't something you'll have to worry about too often when you're working as an electrician, zipping from one job to the next all day long.</p>

This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits. Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Getting your electrical panel inspected and repaired as soon as possible will keep your family connected and safe.</p>

Additional outlets can be powered from either that or the switch box by using the permanent hot and the neutral from either the switch box or the outlet box.</p>
<p>However, there may be local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check these before you begin work. Licenses are issued by the State Electrical Board of North Dakota.
