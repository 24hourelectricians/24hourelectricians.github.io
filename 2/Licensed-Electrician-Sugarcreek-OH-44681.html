A popular type of lighting employs strips of LED lights that can be placed in recessed shelves, behind televisions, and along the ground.

Do not use light duty extension cords in a non-residential situation. Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger.
