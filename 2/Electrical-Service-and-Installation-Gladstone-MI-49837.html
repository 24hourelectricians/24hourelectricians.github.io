Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets.

<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ). The tabs held the box flush with the drywall and kept it from falling in while I screwed them into the studs.
