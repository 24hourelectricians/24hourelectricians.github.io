It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair.

Choose light sources that will be bright enough to satisfy the needs of the area, but that can be installed without producing glare or shining into someone else's yard.</p>
<p>Generators are available through LI Power Solutions, fully installed with no money down. Electricians made a median salary of $55,190 in 2018.
