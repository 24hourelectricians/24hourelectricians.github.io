As for the hands already on the front lines, standard wiring and maintenance jobs remain the bread and butter of electrical contractors' business, but this year's survey finds the growing importance of lighting to ECs' bottom lines, perhaps a result of the rapid growth in LEDs and related control systems.

<p>A path may require a series of short stake lights along its border on one side or on both sides (Image 1). A water fountain can be enhanced with a spotlight (Image 2), and a pond can have soft lighting around its perimeter. Their power strip looks like any other surge suppressor but it has two outlets that receive a continuous current while the remaining six (or eight depending on the model) can be turned on or off with a remote. If you have any questions about whether your electrical panel or wiring will pass inspection, you can check the National Electric Code or your local licensing or inspecting authority.</p>
