Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>
<p>If your home still relies on an old-fashioned panel with fuses, which is common in homes built prior to 1960, then you probably want to upgrade to an electrical panel with circuit breakers.
