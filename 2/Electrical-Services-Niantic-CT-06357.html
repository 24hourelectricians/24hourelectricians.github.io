<h3>Lightning and Static Protection Best Practices in Niantic CT</h3>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>But, it is very easy to overlook the fact that proximity to the wet ground increases the chance of an electric shock.

Trust our experts to install your backup generator, so you can rely on it whenever there's a power outage or emergency.
