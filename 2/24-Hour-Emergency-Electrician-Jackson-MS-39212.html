Journeyman electrician license: You need to show evidence of 8,000 hours of installing electrical or heating equipment, power, light, wiring, or electrical apparatuses.

Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
