<p>Since all your electrical power goes through the breaker panel, it's vital to ensure that the panel is working safely and efficiently. When the service panel starts to wear down, it becomes increasingly susceptible to power surges.

<p>In that case the electrician may run a 14-2 wire (hot, neutral, ground) from the receptacle box to the switch, putting black tape on the ends of the white wire to show that BOTH wires are actually carrying current. This board licenses and regulates electrical contractors; registers qualified journeyman electricians; and is responsible for granting exemptions from licensure to persons or businesses engaged in telecommunications wiring in New Jersey.
