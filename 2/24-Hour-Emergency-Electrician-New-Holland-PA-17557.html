The source neutral is spliced through to the receptacle neutral terminal and the source ground is spliced through to the grounds at the outlet. Electricians might be on their feet all day, crawling through tight spaces, lifting heavy components, and otherwise putting their bodies to the test.</p>
<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed.
