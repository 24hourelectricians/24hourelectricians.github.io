Moreover, it falls in line with light switch height ranges prescribed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Fair Housing Act (FHA) Even if your local electrical code doesn't require a specific minimum height, these acts offer guidance when installing your light switch: According to ADA guidelines, wall controls and outlets that can be reached from a forward position need to be a minimum of 15 inches and a maximum of 48 inches above the ground to be easily reached from a seated position.</p>
