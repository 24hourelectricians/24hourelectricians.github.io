If the electrical work passes, the utility company can reconnect the outside power lines. Talk to Weisman Electric Company about a preventative maintenance plan to keep your generator as efficient as possible. There have been many accidents about fire and shocks caused by electricity.

<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket. You want people driving by to take a second look because what you've created is interesting,‚Äù says Chris Mitchell of landscape lighting firm NiteLiters in Owensboro, Ky. To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling. Avoid placing power cords close to electric devices that emit heat.</p>
