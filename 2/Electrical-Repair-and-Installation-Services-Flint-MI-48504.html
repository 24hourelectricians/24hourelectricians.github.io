<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Flint</h2>
<p>Do you need a logo for an electrical business? Moreover, it falls in line with light switch height ranges prescribed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Fair Housing Act (FHA) Even if your local electrical code doesn't require a specific minimum height, these acts offer guidance when installing your light switch: According to ADA guidelines, wall controls and outlets that can be reached from a forward position need to be a minimum of 15 inches and a maximum of 48 inches above the ground to be easily reached from a seated position.</p>
<p>If one or more of the phases is missing, disconnect the primary voltage source (incoming power disconnect switch) and replace the incoming power fuses or reset the motor-control circuit breaker. That way the second outlet can be switched while leaving the GFI on at all times.
