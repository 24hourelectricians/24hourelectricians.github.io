<p>Other fountains will require overhead lighting to be installed to adjacent trees or structures. Having to throw away all of your food and replace it all is not only costly (not to mention an annoying and time consuming task), but if you're in a situation where you're trapped in your home for a few days because of the weather, you're going to depend on the food you have until you can safely leave your house. When aluminum wires are only twisted together, like you would with copper, the wires expand and contract then current flows through them which produces heat from the poor connection and if the wires has oxidized, this will heat up the connection even further, causing a potential for overheating and a possible fire.</p>

Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in. If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
