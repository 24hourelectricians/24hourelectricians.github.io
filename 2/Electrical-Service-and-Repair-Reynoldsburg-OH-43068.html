Load side transformer wires tend to be the same color and only connections from the transformer to the main are different insulation colors to denote the hot from the neutral wire. Whereas a portable generator can only run a few of your electrical devices, a standby generator has enough juice to power your entire home - this includes your lights, appliances, and even entertainment devices.</p>
