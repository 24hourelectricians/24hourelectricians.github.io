<h3>Precautions To Take When Working On Electrical Wiring Watkinsville GA 30677</h3>
<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone. Portable generators employ propane or gas tanks. Installing a home generator is not as easy as simply plugging it in. In fact, the installation process can be quite complex. The worst time to try installing a portable generator for the first time is in the dark after your power has already gone out.</p>
<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>

A direct lightning strike is an absolutely massive discharge of electricity; a surge protector probably won't stop such a huge surge from damaging things in your home.</p>
<p>On the circuit breaker (frequently located in a basement or garage) you will need to find the specific room you need to power off. The ATS prevents any back feed.‚Äù Back feed occurs when you don't turn off the power coming from the utility line and start your generator at the same time.
