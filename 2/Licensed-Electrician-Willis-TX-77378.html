<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician in Willis</h2>
<p>Importance of hiring a certified and licensed electrician. Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>
<p>Consequently, electricians with less than a year of experience make up just 2 percent of the workforce. Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle.
