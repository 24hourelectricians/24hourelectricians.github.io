It comes in at 22,000 watts and comes with a 200 amp transfer switch which should cover most people's power needs.</p>

This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>
