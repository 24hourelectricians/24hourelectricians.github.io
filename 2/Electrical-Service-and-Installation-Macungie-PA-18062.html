Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals. We do want to make it clear, though, that are probably a lot of great small electrical engineering firms out there; we just focused on the larger firms based on specific requests and available information.</p>

You can easily keep your electronics and home safe with the use of surge protectors that you can find at the web site. Turn off the power to the switch at the main circuit breaker or fuse panel.
