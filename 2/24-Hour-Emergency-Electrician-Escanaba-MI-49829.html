<p>If you are overloading your outlets, you may need to install a new circuit. You can also wire it up so that the switch controls the outlet and the light it's connected to, which may be useful if you have a lamp plugged into the outlet. This course covers the operation and maintenance of high-voltage circuit breakers and switchgear (4 KV and above) that are typically used for in-plant distribution of electrical power. If you don't have adequate knowledge of the numerous wirings of the electrical panel, make sure you contact Mr. Electric for the circuit breaker repair.</p>
<p>This will likely require removing them from the outlet and splicing the two existing black wires, along with two short additional pieces of black wire, into one wire nut. Only use extension cords approved for the environment and loads expected. With 2 short hot wires and 3 neutrals, I connected a pair of the hot and neutral each to back-wire clamps, and used the side screw for the last neutral.

If rewiring becomes necessary, develop a wiring layout with help from local electrical specialists.</p>
