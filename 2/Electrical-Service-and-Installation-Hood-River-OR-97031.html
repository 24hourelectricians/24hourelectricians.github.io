Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>
<p>This may be hard to accept, but extension cords are designed for short-term use only. Some electrical work is fine to DIY, but a licensed electrician should do big jobs like replacing an electrical panel. Your home is outfitted with hundreds of lighting fixtures designed to provide light and comfort when it's dark.
