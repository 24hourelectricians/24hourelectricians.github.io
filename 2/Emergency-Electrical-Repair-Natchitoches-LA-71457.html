<p>Keep all appliance cords away from hot surfaces (toasters, range tops, ovens, etc.). Cords can be damaged by excessive heat. These 12V led lights will not get over heated or burn up like other incandescent or halogen bulb fixtures and will remain pretty cool outside ever after long hours of running since they produce a minimum amount of heat to the surroundings as well. After that, remove the screws on the light switch itself and gently pull it out of the wall.</p>
