From achieving ambient lighting in your living room or kitchen through expert ceiling light fitting or replacing of faulty fixtures with new modern lighting solutions to maximising your wall accent lighting options, the professional electricians can help you out. If the same results still occur (namely, the light only stays ON if the wires are held together - similar to holding down a button), then the relay is the problem and will need replacing.</p>
