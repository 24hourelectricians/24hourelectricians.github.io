The dim lighting means you have to use more fixtures, which creates a sort of landing strip look, or if you are using deck light fixtures they end up looking like a bunch of bug zappers, (without the ability to zap the bugs). The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>Surge protectors are typically installed connected to a home's electrical service box. You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel.

You may be qualified to determine the problem is in the breaker, but you aren't qualified to actually work on that breaker.</p>
