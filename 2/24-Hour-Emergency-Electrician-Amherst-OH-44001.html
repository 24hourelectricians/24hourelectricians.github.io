<p>The size of an electrical service is established by the ampacity (capacity) of the incoming service wires. To handle increased electrical requirements, it's likely you'll also need to upgrade electrical wiring, especially if your house is more than 40 years old. While you don't need a degree to get into this career, electricians can find employment with the completion of an apprenticeship or some postsecondary training. This method of determining size is fraught with problems as the ratings of breakers, fuses and panels may correlate to the size of the electrical service, but in many cases they don't.</p>
