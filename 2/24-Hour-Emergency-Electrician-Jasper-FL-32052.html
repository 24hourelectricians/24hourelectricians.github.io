Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home. People who splice wires by twisting the ends together and covering the result with electrical tape face a higher risk of encountering a problem in the future.</p>
<p>Don't use extension cords as a permanent substitute for additional power sockets, and avoid using them for too many appliances at once.

<p>It's often referred to as the main breaker box or fuse box. Right before and immediately after the storm, people tend to purchase portable generators; once the debris has cleared, many purchase standby” generators, which are more powerful than portable generators (and more expensive) and are installed in the home. Whether you need help installing a light switch, wiring an outlet or running a wire to a new lighting fixture, the Handy platform will connect you with the right electrical service professional with the right experience.</p>
<p>To hardwire a low voltage transformer, the main power should be turned off at the breaker panel before making any electrical connections. Mark Donovan of shows how to wire a combo switch outlet circuit such that the outlet is constantly powered. We do this to aim all your fixtures for optimal lightshed and perform a final voltage check. Or, if the outlets are to also be half-hots, use a three conductor (plus ground) to install between the outlets and splice into both the hot line and the switched line.</p>
