<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>

<p>Homes have much different electrical needs and power loads than large-scale commercial buildings. Almost everything in the world runs on electricity, which means that electricians have a great deal of room to specialize in the field. It is recommended to use power boards always with inbuilt safety devices like overload switches. If you are concerned about thieves or prowlers, having some properly positioned motion activated lighting will make you feel much safer while you sleep and these types of lights will generally cause any potential bandits to quickly flee the area.</p>
