Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency.

Installing pendant, recessed, or landscape lighting are more complicated projects and may require new wiring circuits. This means that we can end up having exposed electrical wires.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair.
