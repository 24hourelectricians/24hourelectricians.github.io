<p>Computers and other electronics need to be protected by a surge-protector and it can help to keep them safe and avoid any damage. Most programs provide everything you need to work in residential settings, but to become a commercial electrician or to work in a specialty area you may need additional training and licensing. Trainees preparing for journeyman electrician testing need to be familiar with national electricity codes as well as local and state electricity codes and regulations.</p>
<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>

Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
